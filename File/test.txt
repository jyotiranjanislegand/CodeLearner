1101. The Earliest Moment When Everyone Become Friends
Description
    In a social group, there are N people, with unique integer ids from 0 to N-1.
    We have a list of logs, where each logs[i] = [timestamp, id_A, id_B] contains a
    non-negative integer timestamp, and the ids of two different people.
    Each log represents the time in which two different people became friends.
    Friendship is symmetric: if A is friends with B, then B is friends with A.
    Let's say that person A is acquainted with person B if A is friends with B, or A
    is a friend of someone acquainted with B.
    Return the earliest time for which every person became acquainted with every
    other person. Return -1 if there is no such earliest time.
Example 1:
    Input: logs = [[20190101,0,1],[20190104,3,4],[20190107,2,3],[20190211,1,5],
    [20190224,2,4],[20190301,0,3],[20190312,1,2],[20190322,4,5]], N = 6
    Output: 20190301
    Explanation:
    The first event occurs at timestamp = 20190101 and after 0 and 1 become friends
    we have the following friendship groups [0,1], [2], [3], [4], [5].
    The second event occurs at timestamp = 20190104 and after 3 and 4 become friends
    we have the following friendship groups [0,1], [2], [3,4], [5].
    The third event occurs at timestamp = 20190107 and after 2 and 3 become friends
    we have the following friendship groups [0,1], [2,3,4], [5].
    The fourth event occurs at timestamp = 20190211 and after 1 and 5 become friends
    we have the following friendship groups [0,1,5], [2,3,4].
    The fifth event occurs at timestamp = 20190224 and as 2 and 4 are already friend
    anything happens.
    The sixth event occurs at timestamp = 20190301 and after 0 and 3 become friends
    we have that all become friends.
     
   Note:
    2 <= N <= 100
    1 <= logs.length <= 10^4
    0 <= logs[i][0] <= 10^9
    0 <= logs[i][1], logs[i][2] <= N - 1
    It's guaranteed that all timestamps in logs[i][0] are different.
    logs are not necessarily ordered by some criteria.
    logs[i][1] != logs[i][2]

1319. Number of Operations to Make Network Connected
Description
    There are n computers numbered from 0 to n-1 connected by ethernet cables
    connections forming a network where connections[i] = [a, b] represents a
    connection between computers a and b. Any computer can reach any other computer
    directly or indirectly through the network.
    Given an initial computer network connections. You can extract certain cables
    between two directly connected computers, and place them between any pair of
    disconnected computers to make them directly connected. Return the minimum
    number of times you need to do this in order to make all the computers
    connected. If it's not possible, return -1.
Example 1:
    Input: n = 4, connections = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,2]]
    Output: 1
     
       Explanation: Remove cable between computer 1 and 2 and place between computers 1
    and 3.
    Example 2:
    Input: n = 6, connections = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3],[1,2],[1,3]]
    Output: 2
    Example 3:
    Input: n = 6, connections = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3],[1,2]]
    Output: -1
    Explanation: There are not enough cables.
    Example 4:
    Input: n = 5, connections = [[0,1],[0,2],[3,4],[2,3]]
    Output: 0
    Constraints:
    1 <= n <= 10^5
    1 <= connections.length <= min(n*(n-1)/2, 10^5)
    connections[i].length == 2
    0 <= connections[i][0], connections[i][1] < n
    connections[i][0] != connections[i][1]
    There are no repeated connections.
    No two computers are connected by more than one cable.

 Binary Search 69. Sqrt(x)
 Description
   Implement int sqrt(int x).
Compute and return the square root of x, where x is guaranteed to be a non-
negative integer.

   Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated and only
the integer part of the result is returned.
Example 1:
Input: 4
Output: 2
Example 2:
Input: 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since
the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.
 Solution

 275. H-Index II
 Description
   Given an array of citations sorted in ascending order (each citation is a non-
negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's
h-index.

       According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if
    h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N − h papers
    have no more than h citations each."
Example:
    Input: citations = [0,1,3,5,6]
    Output: 3
    Explanation: [0,1,3,5,6] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of
    them had
                 received 0, 1, 3, 5, 6 citations respectively.
                 Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each
    and the remaining
                 two with no more than 3 citations each, her h-index is 3.
Note:
    If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-
    index.
Follow up:
    This is a follow up problem to H-Index, where citations is now guaranteed to be
    sorted in ascending order.
    Could you solve it in logarithmic time complexity?
Solution
05/31/2020:
    class Solution {
public:
  int hIndex(vector<int>& citations) {
    int n = citations.size(), lo = 0, hi = n - 1;

      int mid = lo + ((hi - lo) >> 1);
      if (citations[n - 1 - mid] >= mid + 1) {
        lo = mid + 1;
      } else {
hi = mid - 1; }
}
return lo; }

441. Arranging Coins
    
         You have a total of n coins that you want to form in a staircase shape, where
    every k-th row must have exactly k coins.
    Given n, find the total number of full staircase rows that can be formed.
    n is a non-negative integer and fits within the range of a 32-bit signed
    integer.
Example 1: n=5
The coins can form the following rows: ¤

   [1,1,1] ]
Output: [
      [1,0,1],
      [0,0,0],
      [1,0,1]

      [0,4,5,0],
      [0,3,1,0]

Follow up:
    A straight forward solution using O(mn) space is probably a bad idea.
    A simple improvement uses O(m + n) space, but still not the best solution.
    Could you devise a constant space solution?

     Given an array of integers that is already sorted in ascending order, find two
numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.
The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add
up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2.
Note:
Your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution and you may not
use the same element twice.

463. Island Perimeter
    You are given a map in form of a two-dimensional integer grid where 1 represents
land and 0 represents water.
Grid cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally). The grid is
completely surrounded by water, and there is exactly one island (i.e., one or
more connected land cells).
The island doesn't have "lakes" (water inside that isn't connected to the water
around the island). One cell is a square with side length 1. The grid is
rectangular, width and height don't exceed 100. Determine the perimeter of the
island.
Example:
Input:
[[0,1,0,0],
 [1,1,1,0],
 [0,1,0,0],
 [1,1,0,0]]
Output: 16
Explanation: The perimeter is the 16 yellow stripes in the image below:

509. Fibonacci Number
    The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted F(n) form a sequence, called the
Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones,
starting from 0 and 1. That is,
F(0)=0, F(1)=1
F(N) = F(N - 1) + F(N - 2), for N > 1. Given N, calculate F(N).
Example 1:
Input: 2
Output: 1
Explanation: F(2) = F(1) + F(0) = 1 + 0 = 1.
Example 2:

   Input: 3
Output: 2
Explanation: F(3) = F(2) + F(1) = 1 + 1 = 2.
Example 3:
Input: 4
Output: 3
Explanation: F(4) = F(3) + F(2) = 2 + 1 = 3.
    Note:
    0 ≤ N ≤ 30.

 561. Array Partition I
 Description

    Given an array of 2n integers, your task is to group these integers into n pairs
of integer, say (a1, b1), (a2, b2), ..., (an, bn) which makes sum of min(ai, bi)
for all i from 1 to n as large as possible.
Example 1:
Input: [1,4,3,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: n is 2, and the maximum sum of pairs is 4 = min(1, 2) + min(3, 4).
Note:
n is a positive integer, which is in the range of [1, 10000].
All the integers in the array will be in the range of [-10000, 10000].
 Solution
01/30/2020:

 566. Reshape the Matrix
 Description
   In MATLAB, there is a very useful function called 'reshape', which can reshape a
matrix into a new one with different size but keep its original data.
You're given a matrix represented by a two-dimensional array, and two positive
integers r and c representing the row number and column number of the wanted
reshaped matrix, respectively.
The reshaped matrix need to be filled with all the elements of the original
matrix in the same row-traversing order as they were.
If the 'reshape' operation with given parameters is possible and legal, output
the new reshaped matrix; Otherwise, output the original matrix.

   Example 1:
    Input:
    nums =
    [[1,2],
     [3,4]]
    r = 1, c = 4
    Output:
    [[1,2,3,4]]
    Explanation:
    The row-traversing of nums is [1,2,3,4]. The new reshaped matrix is a 1 * 4
    matrix, fill it row by row by using the previous list.
    Example 2:
    Input:
    nums =
    [[1,2],
     [3,4]]
    r = 2, c = 4
    Output:
    [[1,2],
     [3,4]]
    Explanation:
    There is no way to reshape a 2 * 2 matrix to a 2 * 4 matrix. So output the
    original matrix.
    Note:
    The height and width of the given matrix is in range [1, 100].
    The given r and c are all positive.
Solution
05/10/2020:
    class Solution {
    public:
      vector<vector<int>> matrixReshape(vector<vector<int>>& nums, int r, int c) {
        if (nums.empty() && nums[0].empty()) return { {} };
        int m = nums.size(), n = nums[0].size();
        if (m * n != r * c) return nums;
        vector<vector<int>> ret(r, vector<int>(c, 0));
        for (int i = 0; i < r; ++i) {
          for (int j = 0; j < c; ++j) {
            int idx = i * c + j;
            ret[i][j] = nums[idx / n][(idx % n)];
} }
    
   };
Description
594. Longest Harmonious Subsequence
return ret; }
     We define a harmounious array as an array where the difference between its
maximum value and its minimum value is exactly 1.
Now, given an integer array, you need to find the length of its longest
harmonious subsequence among all its possible subsequences.
Example 1:
Input: [1,3,2,2,5,2,3,7]
Output: 5
Explanation: The longest harmonious subsequence is [3,2,2,2,3].
 Solution
05/18/2020:

    int ret = 0;
    for (auto& m : cnt)
      if (cnt[m.first - 1] > 0 && cnt[m.first] > 0)

 624. Maximum Distance in Arrays
 Description

    Given m arrays, and each array is sorted in ascending order. Now you can pick up
two integers from two different arrays (each array picks one) and calculate the
distance. We define the distance between two integers a and b to be their
absolute difference |a-b|. Your task is to find the maximum distance.
Example 1:
Input:
[[1,2,3],
[4,5],
 [1,2,3]]
Output: 4
Explanation:
One way to reach the maximum distance 4 is to pick 1 in the first or third array
and pick 5 in the second array.
Note:
Each given array will have at least 1 number. There will be at least two non-
empty arrays.
The total number of the integers in all the m arrays will be in the range of [2,
10000].
The integers in the m arrays will be in the range of [-10000, 10000].

 654. Maximum Binary Tree
 Description

    Given an integer array with no duplicates. A maximum tree building on this array
is defined as follow:
The root is the maximum number in the array.
The left subtree is the maximum tree constructed from left part subarray divided
by the maximum number.
The right subtree is the maximum tree constructed from right part subarray
divided by the maximum number.
Construct the maximum tree by the given array and output the root node of this
tree.
Example 1:
Input: [3,2,1,6,0,5]
Output: return the tree root node representing the following tree:
6 /\ 35
\/ 20
\ 1
Note:
The size of the given array will be in the range [1,1000].
 Solution
Discussion: Mimicking merge_sort, we can split the array into left subarray and right subarray which are separated by the maximum of the array. The subtrees constructed by left subarray and right subarray becomes left subtree and right subtree, respectively. Time Complexity: O(n^2) and Space Complexity: O(n^2).
 
    class Solution {
public:
  TreeNode* constructMaximumBinaryTree(vector<int>& nums) {
    if (nums.size() == 0) return nullptr;
    auto max_iter = max_element(nums.begin(), nums.end());
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(*max_iter);
    vector<int> nums_left(nums.begin(), max_iter);
    vector<int> nums_right(max_iter + 1, nums.end());
    root->left = constructMaximumBinaryTree(nums_left);
    root->right = constructMaximumBinaryTree(nums_right);
    return root;
} };
 It could be more space efficient with Space Complexity O(n):
   class Solution {
public:
  TreeNode* constructMaximumBinaryTree(vector<int>& nums, int start = 0, int
stop = INT_MAX) {
    if (stop == INT_MAX) stop = nums.size() - 1;
    if (start > stop) return nullptr;
    auto middle = max_element(nums.begin() + start, nums.begin() + stop + 1) -
nums.begin();
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(nums[middle]);
    root->left = constructMaximumBinaryTree(nums, start, middle - 1);
    root->right = constructMaximumBinaryTree(nums, middle + 1, stop);
    return root;
} };
 623. Add One Row to Tree
Description
    Given the root of a binary tree, then value v and depth d, you need to add a row
    of nodes with value v at the given depth d. The root node is at depth 1.
    The adding rule is: given a positive integer depth d, for each NOT null tree
    nodes N in depth d-1, create two tree nodes with value v as N's left subtree
    root and right subtree root. And N's original left subtree should be the left
    subtree of the new left subtree root, its original right subtree should be the
    right subtree of the new right subtree root. If depth d is 1 that means there is
    no depth d-1 at all, then create a tree node with value v as the new root of the
    whole original tree, and the original tree is the new root's left subtree.
    
   Example 1:
Input:
A binary tree as following:
4 /\ 26
/\/ 315
v=1 d=2 Output:
4
/\ 11 /\ 26
/\/ 315
Example 2:
Input:
A binary tree as following:
4 /
2 /\ 31
v=1 d=3 Output:
4 /
2
/\ 11 /\ 31
Note:
The given d is in range [1, maximum depth of the given tree + 1].
The given binary tree has at least one tree node.
 
 Solution

   /**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
* int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;

 695. Max Area of Island
 Description

    Given a non-empty 2D array grid of 0's and 1's, an island is a group of 1's
(representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.) You may
assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.
Find the maximum area of an island in the given 2D array. (If there is no
island, the maximum area is 0.)
Example 1:
[[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],
 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
 [0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
 [0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],
 [0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],
 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],
 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]]
Given the above grid, return 6. Note the answer is not 11, because the island
must be connected 4-directionally.
Example 2:
[[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]
Given the above grid, return 0.
Note: The length of each dimension in the given grid does not exceed 50.
 Solution
01/26/2020:
    class Solution {
    public:
      int maxAreaOfIsland(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int m = grid.size(), n = grid[0].size();
        int ret = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
          for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            int area = 0;
            if (grid[i][j] == 1) dfs(grid, i, j, area);
            ret = max(ret, area);
} }
return ret; }
      void dfs(vector<vector<int>>& grid, int i, int j, int& area) {
        int m = grid.size(), n = grid[0].size();
        if (grid[i][j] == 1) {
   area += 1;

             grid[i][j] = 0;
          if (i > 0) dfs(grid, i - 1, j, area);
          if (j > 0) dfs(grid, i, j - 1, area);
          if (i < m - 1) dfs(grid, i + 1, j, area);
          if (j < n - 1) dfs(grid, i, j + 1, area);
} }

Description
 760. Find Anagram Mappings
    Given two lists Aand B, and B is an anagram of A. B is an anagram of A means B
is made by randomizing the order of the elements in A.
We want to find an index mapping P, from A to B. A mapping P[i] = j means the
ith element in A appears in B at index j.
These lists A and B may contain duplicates. If there are multiple answers,
output any of them.
For example, given
A = [12, 28, 46, 32, 50]
B = [50, 12, 32, 46, 28]
We should return
[1, 4, 3, 2, 0]
as P[0] = 1 because the 0th element of A appears at B[1], and P[1] = 4 because
the 1st element of A appears at B[4], and so on.
Note:
A, B have equal lengths in range [1, 100].
A[i], B[i] are integers in range [0, 10^5].
 Solution
01/29/2020:
    class Solution {
    public:
   vector<int> anagramMappings(vector<int>& A, vector<int>& B) {
  unordered_map<int, int> m;
  vector<int> ret(A.size(), 0);
  for (int i = 0; i < B.size(); ++i) {

   m[B[i]] = i; }
for (int i = 0; i < (int)A.size(); ++i) {
  ret[i] = m[A[i]];
}
return ret; }
};
Description
766. Toeplitz Matrix
     A matrix is Toeplitz if every diagonal from top-left to bottom-right has the
same element.
Now given an M x N matrix, return True if and only if the matrix is Toeplitz.
Example 1:
Input:
matrix = [
  [1,2,3,4],
  [5,1,2,3],
  [9,5,1,2]
]
Output: True
Explanation:
In the above grid, the diagonals are:
"[9]", "[5, 5]", "[1, 1, 1]", "[2, 2, 2]", "[3, 3]", "[4]".
In each diagonal all elements are the same, so the answer is True.
Example 2:
Input:
matrix = [
[1,2],
[2,2] ]
Output: False
Explanation:
The diagonal "[1, 2]" has different elements.
Note:
matrix will be a 2D array of integers.

   matrix will have a number of rows and columns in range [1, 20].
matrix[i][j] will be integers in range [0, 99].
Follow up:
What if the matrix is stored on disk, and the memory is limited such that you
can only load at most one row of the matrix into the memory at once?
What if the matrix is so large that you can only load up a partial row into the
memory at once?
 Solution
02/03/2020:
   class Solution {
public:
  bool isToeplitzMatrix(vector<vector<int>>& matrix) {
    for (int i = 0; i < (int)matrix.size(); ++i) {
      for (int k = 1; k < (int)matrix[0].size(); ++k) {
        if (i + k < (int)matrix.size() && matrix[i + k][k] != matrix[i + k - 1]
[k - 1]) {
          return false;
} }
    }
    for (int j = 0; j < (int)matrix[0].size(); ++j) {
      for (int k = 1; k < (int)matrix.size(); ++k) {
        if (j + k < (int)matrix[0].size() && matrix[k][j + k] != matrix[k - 1][j
+ k - 1]) {
          return false;
} }
}
    return true;
  }
};
 811. Subdomain Visit Count
 Description

    A website domain like "discuss.leetcode.com" consists of various subdomains. At
the top level, we have "com", at the next level, we have "leetcode.com", and at
the lowest level, "discuss.leetcode.com". When we visit a domain like
"discuss.leetcode.com", we will also visit the parent domains "leetcode.com" and
"com" implicitly.
Now, call a "count-paired domain" to be a count (representing the number of
visits this domain received), followed by a space, followed by the address. An
example of a count-paired domain might be "9001 discuss.leetcode.com".
We are given a list cpdomains of count-paired domains. We would like a list of
count-paired domains, (in the same format as the input, and in any order), that
explicitly counts the number of visits to each subdomain.
Example 1:
Input:
["9001 discuss.leetcode.com"]
Output:
["9001 discuss.leetcode.com", "9001 leetcode.com", "9001 com"]
Explanation:
We only have one website domain: "discuss.leetcode.com". As discussed above, the
subdomain "leetcode.com" and "com" will also be visited. So they will all be
visited 9001 times.
Example 2:
Input:
["900 google.mail.com", "50 yahoo.com", "1 intel.mail.com", "5 wiki.org"]
Output:
["901 mail.com","50 yahoo.com","900 google.mail.com","5 wiki.org","5 org","1
intel.mail.com","951 com"]
Explanation:
We will visit "google.mail.com" 900 times, "yahoo.com" 50 times,
"intel.mail.com" once and "wiki.org" 5 times. For the subdomains, we will visit
"mail.com" 900 + 1 = 901 times, "com" 900 + 50 + 1 = 951 times, and "org" 5
times.
Notes:
The length of cpdomains will not exceed 100.
The length of each domain name will not exceed 100.
Each address will have either 1 or 2 "." characters.
The input count in any count-paired domain will not exceed 10000.
The answer output can be returned in any order.

        cnt[str] += n;
        int i = 0;
        for (; i < (int)str.size(); ++i) {

            break;
} }
        if (i < str.size()) {
          str = str.substr(i + 1, str.size() - i - 1);
        } else {
          str = "";
} }
    }
    vector<string> ret;
    for (auto it = cnt.begin(); it != cnt.end(); ++it) {
      // cout << it->first << " " << it->second << endl;
      ret.push_back(to_string(it->second) + " " + it->first);
    }
return ret; }

 Description
832. Flipping an Image
    Given a binary matrix A, we want to flip the image horizontally, then invert it,
and return the resulting image.
To flip an image horizontally means that each row of the image is reversed.  For
example, flipping [1, 1, 0] horizontally results in [0, 1, 1].

   To invert an image means that each 0 is replaced by 1, and each 1 is replaced by
0. For example, inverting [0, 1, 1] results in [1, 0, 0].
Example 1:
Input: [[1,1,0],[1,0,1],[0,0,0]]
Output: [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[1,1,1]]
Explanation: First reverse each row: [[0,1,1],[1,0,1],[0,0,0]].
Then, invert the image: [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[1,1,1]]
Example 2:
Input: [[1,1,0,0],[1,0,0,1],[0,1,1,1],[1,0,1,0]]
Output: [[1,1,0,0],[0,1,1,0],[0,0,0,1],[1,0,1,0]]
Explanation: First reverse each row: [[0,0,1,1],[1,0,0,1],[1,1,1,0],[0,1,0,1]].
Then invert the image: [[1,1,0,0],[0,1,1,0],[0,0,0,1],[1,0,1,0]]
Notes:
1 <= A.length = A[0].length <= 20
0 <= A[i][j] <= 1
 Solution
01/29/2020:
   class Solution {
public:
  vector<vector<int>> flipAndInvertImage(vector<vector<int>>& A) {

    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
      for (int l = 0, r = n - 1; l < r; ++l, --r) {
        swap(A[i][l], A[i][r]);
        A[i][l] ^= 1;
        A[i][r] ^= 1;

        A[i][n / 2] ^= 1;

 852. Peak Index in a Mountain Array
 
 Description
   Let's call an array A a mountain if the following properties hold:
A.length >= 3
There exists some 0 < i < A.length - 1 such that A[0] < A[1] < ... A[i-1] < A[i]
> A[i+1] > ... > A[A.length - 1]
Given an array that is definitely a mountain, return any i such that A[0] < A[1]
< ... A[i-1] < A[i] > A[i+1] > ... > A[A.length - 1].
Example 1:
Input: [0,1,0]
Output: 1
Example 2:
Input: [0,2,1,0]
Output: 1
Note:
3 <= A.length <= 10000
0 <= A[i] <= 10^6
A is a mountain, as defined above.

        return i;
} }
    return A.size() - 1;
  }
};
 867. Transpose Matrix
 Description
   Given a matrix A, return the transpose of A.

    The transpose of a matrix is the matrix flipped over it's main diagonal,
switching the row and column indices of the matrix.
Example 1:
Input: [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
Output: [[1,4,7],[2,5,8],[3,6,9]]
Example 2:
Input: [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]
Output: [[1,4],[2,5],[3,6]]
Note:
1 <= A.length <= 1000
1 <= A[0].length <= 1000

 905. Sort Array By Parity
 Description

    Given an array A of non-negative integers, return an array consisting of all the
even elements of A, followed by all the odd elements of A.
You may return any answer array that satisfies this condition.
Example 1:
Input: [3,1,2,4]
Output: [2,4,3,1]
The outputs [4,2,3,1], [2,4,1,3], and [4,2,1,3] would also be accepted.
Note:
1 <= A.length <= 5000
0 <= A[i] <= 5000
 Solution

   class Solution {
public:

        odd.push_back(n);
      } else {
        even.push_back(n);

    even.insert(even.end(), odd.begin(), odd.end());
    return even;
  }
};
 918. Maximum Sum Circular Subarray
 Description

    Given a circular array C of integers represented by A, find the maximum possible
sum of a non-empty subarray of C.
Here, a circular array means the end of the array connects to the beginning of
the array.  (Formally, C[i] = A[i] when 0 <= i < A.length, and C[i+A.length] =
C[i] when i >= 0.)
Also, a subarray may only include each element of the fixed buffer A at most
once.  (Formally, for a subarray C[i], C[i+1], ..., C[j], there does not exist i
<= k1, k2 <= j with k1 % A.length = k2 % A.length.)
Example 1:
Input: [1,-2,3,-2]
Output: 3
Explanation: Subarray [3] has maximum sum 3
Example 2:
Input: [5,-3,5]
Output: 10
Explanation: Subarray [5,5] has maximum sum 5 + 5 = 10
Example 3:
Input: [3,-1,2,-1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Subarray [2,-1,3] has maximum sum 2 + (-1) + 3 = 4
Example 4:
Input: [3,-2,2,-3]
Output: 3
Explanation: Subarray [3] and [3,-2,2] both have maximum sum 3
Example 5:
Input: [-2,-3,-1]
Output: -1
Explanation: Subarray [-1] has maximum sum -1
Note:
-30000 <= A[i] <= 30000
1 <= A.length <= 30000

  922. Sort Array By Parity II
 Description
   Given an array A of non-negative integers, half of the integers in A are odd,
and half of the integers are even.
Sort the array so that whenever A[i] is odd, i is odd; and whenever A[i] is
even, i is even.
You may return any answer array that satisfies this condition.
Example 1:
Input: [4,2,5,7]
Output: [4,5,2,7]
Explanation: [4,7,2,5], [2,5,4,7], [2,7,4,5] would also have been accepted.
Note:
2 <= A.length <= 20000
A.length % 2 == 0
0 <= A[i] <= 1000

 977. Squares of a Sorted Array
 Description
   Given an array of integers A sorted in non-decreasing order, return an array of
the squares of each number, also in sorted non-decreasing order.
Example 1:
Input: [-4,-1,0,3,10]
Output: [0,1,9,16,100]
Example 2:
Input: [-7,-3,2,3,11]
Output: [4,9,9,49,121]
Note:
1 <= A.length <= 10000
-10000 <= A[i] <= 10000
A is sorted in non-decreasing order.
 Solution

Description
994. Rotting Oranges
     In a given grid, each cell can have one of three values:
the value 0 representing an empty cell;
the value 1 representing a fresh orange;
the value 2 representing a rotten orange.
Every minute, any fresh orange that is adjacent (4-directionally) to a rotten
orange becomes rotten.
Return the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh
orange.  If this is impossible, return -1 instead.
Example 1:
Input: [[2,1,1],[1,1,0],[0,1,1]]
Output: 4
Example 2:
Input: [[2,1,1],[0,1,1],[1,0,1]]
Output: -1
Explanation:  The orange in the bottom left corner (row 2, column 0) is never
rotten, because rotting only happens 4-directionally.
Example 3:

       Input: [[0,2]]
    Output: 0
    Explanation:  Since there are already no fresh oranges at minute 0, the answer
    is just 0.
Note:
    1 <= grid.length <= 10
    1 <= grid[0].length <= 10
    grid[i][j] is only 0, 1, or 2.

 Description
1064. Fixed Point
    Given an array A of distinct integers sorted in ascending order, return the
smallest index i that satisfies A[i] == i.  Return -1 if no such i exists.
Example 1:
Input: [-10,-5,0,3,7]
Output: 3
Explanation:
For the given array, A[0] = -10, A[1] = -5, A[2] = 0, A[3] = 3, thus the output
is 3.
Example 2:
Input: [0,2,5,8,17]
Output: 0
Explanation:
A[0] = 0, thus the output is 0.
Example 3:
Input: [-10,-5,3,4,7,9]
Output: -1
Explanation:
There is no such i that A[i] = i, thus the output is -1.
Note:
1 <= A.length < 10^4
-10^9 <= A[i] <= 10^9
 Solution

 1085. Sum of Digits in the Minimum Number
 Description
   Given an array A of positive integers, let S be the sum of the digits of the
minimal element of A.
Return 0 if S is odd, otherwise return 1.
Example 1:
Input: [34,23,1,24,75,33,54,8]

   Output: 0
Explanation:
The minimal element is 1, and the sum of those digits is S = 1 which is odd, so
the answer is 0.
Example 2:
Input: [99,77,33,66,55]
Output: 1
Explanation:
The minimal element is 33, and the sum of those digits is S = 3 + 3 = 6 which is
even, so the answer is 1.
Note:
    1 <= A.length <= 100
    1 <= A[i].length <= 100
Solution
01/30/2020:
    class Solution {

 1086. High Five
 Description
   Given a list of scores of different students, return the average score of each
student's top five scores in the order of each student's id.
Each entry items[i] has items[i][0] the student's id, and items[i][1] the
student's score.  The average score is calculated using integer division.

   Example 1:
    Input: [[1,91],[1,92],[2,93],[2,97],[1,60],[2,77],[1,65],[1,87],[1,100],[2,100],
    [2,76]]
    Output: [[1,87],[2,88]]
    Explanation:
    The average of the student with id = 1 is 87.
    The average of the student with id = 2 is 88.6. But with integer division their
    average converts to 88.
Note:
    1 <= items.length <= 1000
    items[i].length == 2
    The IDs of the students is between 1 to 1000
    The score of the students is between 1 to 100
    For each student, there are at least 5 scores
Solution
01/30/2020:

Description
1099. Two Sum Less Than K
     Given an array A of integers and integer K, return the maximum S such that there
exists i < j with A[i] + A[j] = S and S < K. If no i, j exist satisfying this
equation, return -1.
Example 1:
Input: A = [34,23,1,24,75,33,54,8], K = 60
Output: 58
Explanation:
We can use 34 and 24 to sum 58 which is less than 60.
Example 2:
Input: A = [10,20,30], K = 15
Output: -1
Explanation:
In this case it's not possible to get a pair sum less that 15.

1122. Relative Sort Array
if (s < K) {
  ret = max(ret, s);
  ++l;
     Given two arrays arr1 and arr2, the elements of arr2 are distinct, and all
elements in arr2 are also in arr1.
Sort the elements of arr1 such that the relative ordering of items in arr1 are
the same as in arr2.  Elements that don't appear in arr2 should be placed at the
end of arr1 in ascending order.
Example 1:
Input: arr1 = [2,3,1,3,2,4,6,7,9,2,19], arr2 = [2,1,4,3,9,6]
Output: [2,2,2,1,4,3,3,9,6,7,19]
Constraints:
arr1.length, arr2.length <= 1000
0 <= arr1[i], arr2[i] <= 1000

If no integer occurs once, return -1.
Example 1:
Input: [5,7,3,9,4,9,8,3,1]
Output: 8
Explanation:
The maximum integer in the array is 9 but it is repeated. The number 8 occurs
only once, so it's the answer.
Example 2:
Input: [9,9,8,8]

    have a basket that can carry up to 5000 units of weight.
    Return the maximum number of apples you can put in the basket.
Example 1:
    Input: arr = [100,200,150,1000]
    Output: 4

 1217. Play with Chips
 Description
   There are some chips, and the i-th chip is at position chips[i].
You can perform any of the two following types of moves any number of times
(possibly zero) on any chip:
Move the i-th chip by 2 units to the left or to the right with a cost of 0.
Move the i-th chip by 1 unit to the left or to the right with a cost of 1.
There can be two or more chips at the same position initially.
Return the minimum cost needed to move all the chips to the same position (any
position).
Example 1:
Input: chips = [1,2,3]
Output: 1
Explanation: Second chip will be moved to positon 3 with cost 1. First chip will
be moved to position 3 with cost 0. Total cost is 1.
Example 2:
Input: chips = [2,2,2,3,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: Both fourth and fifth chip will be moved to position two with cost
1. Total minimum cost will be 2.
Constraints:
1 <= chips.length <= 100
1 <= chips[i] <= 10^9

}
     Given an initial array arr, every day you produce a new array using the array of
the previous day.
On the i-th day, you do the following operations on the array of day i-1 to
produce the array of day i:
If an element is smaller than both its left neighbor and its right neighbor,
then this element is incremented.
If an element is bigger than both its left neighbor and its right neighbor, then
this element is decremented.
The first and last elements never change.
After some days, the array does not change. Return that final array.
Example 1:
Input: arr = [6,2,3,4]
Output: [6,3,3,4]
Explanation:
On the first day, the array is changed from [6,2,3,4] to [6,3,3,4].
No more operations can be done to this array.
Example 2:
Input: arr = [1,6,3,4,3,5]
Output: [1,4,4,4,4,5]
Explanation:
On the first day, the array is changed from [1,6,3,4,3,5] to [1,5,4,3,4,5].
On the second day, the array is changed from [1,5,4,3,4,5] to [1,4,4,4,4,5].

   No more operations can be done to this array.

    Given n and m which are the dimensions of a matrix initialized by zeros and
given an array indices where indices[i] = [ri, ci]. For each pair of [ri, ci]
you have to increment all cells in row ri and column ci by 1.
Return the number of cells with odd values in the matrix after applying the
increment to all indices.
Example 1:

   Input: n = 2, m = 3, indices = [[0,1],[1,1]]
Output: 6
Explanation: Initial matrix = [[0,0,0],[0,0,0]].
After applying first increment it becomes [[1,2,1],[0,1,0]].

 1266. Minimum Time Visiting All Points
 
 Description
   On a plane there are n points with integer coordinates points[i] = [xi, yi].
Your task is to find the minimum time in seconds to visit all points.
You can move according to the next rules:
In one second always you can either move vertically, horizontally by one unit or
diagonally (it means to move one unit vertically and one unit horizontally in
one second).
You have to visit the points in the same order as they appear in the array.
Example 1:
Input: points = [[1,1],[3,4],[-1,0]]
Output: 7
Explanation: One optimal path is [1,1] -> [2,2] -> [3,3] -> [3,4] -> [2,3] ->
[1,2] -> [0,1] -> [-1,0]
Time from [1,1] to [3,4] = 3 seconds
Time from [3,4] to [-1,0] = 4 seconds
Total time = 7 seconds
Example 2:
Input: points = [[3,2],[-2,2]]
Output: 5
Constraints:
points.length == n
1 <= n <= 100
points[i].length == 2

    length encoding.
    Consider each adjacent pair of elements [a, b] = [nums[2*i], nums[2*i+1]] (with
    i >= 0).  For each such pair, there are a elements with value b in the
    decompressed list.
    
   Return the decompressed list.
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [2,4,4,4]
Explanation: The first pair [1,2] means we have freq = 1 and val = 2 so we
generate the array [2].
The second pair [3,4] means we have freq = 3 and val = 4 so we generate [4,4,4].
At the end the concatenation [2] + [4,4,4,4] is [2,4,4,4].

 1337. The K Weakest Rows in a Matrix
 Description
   Given a m * n matrix mat of ones (representing soldiers) and zeros (representing
civilians), return the indexes of the k weakest rows in the matrix ordered from
the weakest to the strongest.

    A row i is weaker than row j, if the number of soldiers in row i is less than
the number of soldiers in row j, or they have the same number of soldiers but i
is less than j. Soldiers are always stand in the frontier of a row, that is,
always ones may appear first and then zeros.
Example 1:
Input: mat =
[[1,1,0,0,0],
 [1,1,1,1,0],
 [1,0,0,0,0],
 [1,1,0,0,0],
[1,1,1,1,1]],
k=3
Output: [2,0,3]
Explanation:
The number of soldiers for each row is: row 0 -> 2
row 1 -> 4
row 2 -> 1
row 3 -> 2
row 4 -> 5
Rows ordered from the weakest to the strongest are [2,0,3,1,4]
Example 2:
Input: mat =
[[1,0,0,0],
 [1,1,1,1],
 [1,0,0,0],
[1,0,0,0]],
k=2
Output: [0,2]
Explanation:
The number of soldiers for each row is: row 0 -> 1
row 1 -> 4
row 2 -> 1
row 3 -> 1
Rows ordered from the weakest to the strongest are [0,2,3,1]
Constraints:

 1338. Reduce Array Size to The Half
 Description
   Given an array arr.  You can choose a set of integers and remove all the
occurrences of these integers in the array.
Return the minimum size of the set so that at least half of the integers of the
array are removed.

   Example 1:
    Input: arr = [3,3,3,3,5,5,5,2,2,7]
    Output: 2
    Explanation: Choosing {3,7} will make the new array [5,5,5,2,2] which has size 5
    (i.e equal to half of the size of the old array).
    Possible sets of size 2 are {3,5},{3,2},{5,2}.
    Choosing set {2,7} is not possible as it will make the new array [3,3,3,3,5,5,5]
    which has size greater than half of the size of the old array.
    Example 2:
    Input: arr = [7,7,7,7,7,7]
    Output: 1
    Explanation: The only possible set you can choose is {7}. This will make the new
    array empty.
    Example 3:
    Input: arr = [1,9]
    Output: 1
    Example 4:
    Input: arr = [1000,1000,3,7]

1413. Minimum Value to Get Positive Step by Step Sum
Description
    Given an array of integers nums, you start with an initial positive value
    startValue.
    In each iteration, you calculate the step by step sum of startValue plus
    elements in nums (from left to right).
    Return the minimum positive value of startValue such that the step by step sum
    is never less than 1.
Example 1:
    Input: nums = [-3,2,-3,4,2]
    Output: 5
    Explanation: If you choose startValue = 4, in the third iteration your step by
    step sum is less than 1.
     Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,2]
Output: 1
step by step sum
startValue = 4 | startValue = 5 | nums
(4-3)=1 |(5-3)=2 | -3 (1+2)=3 |(2+2)=4 | 2 (3-3)=0 |(4-3)=1 | -3 (0+4)=4 |(1+4)=5 | 4 (4+2)=6 |(5+2)=7 | 2

       Explanation: Minimum start value should be positive.
    Example 3:
    Input: nums = [1,-2,-3]
    Output: 5
    Constraints:
    1 <= nums.length <= 100
    -100 <= nums[i] <= 100

 1423. Maximum Points You Can Obtain from Cards
Description
    There are several cards arranged in a row, and each card has an associated
    number of points The points are given in the integer array cardPoints.
    In one step, you can take one card from the beginning or from the end of the
    row. You have to take exactly k cards.
    Your score is the sum of the points of the cards you have taken.
    Given the integer array cardPoints and the integer k, return the maximum score
    you can obtain.
    Example 1:
    Input: cardPoints = [1,2,3,4,5,6,1], k = 3
    
       Output: 12
    Explanation: After the first step, your score will always be 1. However,
    choosing the rightmost card first will maximize your total score. The optimal
    strategy is to take the three cards on the right, giving a final score of 1 + 6
    + 5 = 12.
    Example 2:
    Input: cardPoints = [2,2,2], k = 2
    Output: 4
    Explanation: Regardless of which two cards you take, your score will always be
    4.
    Example 3:
    Input: cardPoints = [9,7,7,9,7,7,9], k = 7
    Output: 55
    Explanation: You have to take all the cards. Your score is the sum of points of
    all cards.
    Example 4:
    Input: cardPoints = [1,1000,1], k = 1
    Output: 1
    Explanation: You cannot take the card in the middle. Your best score is 1.

Description
1425. Constrained Subset Sum
     Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the maximum sum of a non-
empty subset of that array such that for every two consecutive integers in the
subset, nums[i] and nums[j], where i < j, the condition j - i <= k is satisfied.
A subset of an array is obtained by deleting some number of elements (can be
zero) from the array, leaving the remaining elements in their original order.
Example 1:
Input: nums = [10,2,-10,5,20], k = 2
Output: 37
Explanation: The subset is [10, 2, 5, 20].
Example 2:
Input: nums = [-1,-2,-3], k = 1
Output: -1
Explanation: The subset must be non-empty, so we choose the largest number.

 Description
1428. Leftmost Column with at Least a One
    (This problem is an interactive problem.)
A binary matrix means that all elements are 0 or 1. For each individual row of
the matrix, this row is sorted in non-decreasing order.
Given a row-sorted binary matrix binaryMatrix, return leftmost column index(0-
indexed) with at least a 1 in it. If such index doesn't exist, return -1.
You can't access the Binary Matrix directly.  You may only access the matrix
using a BinaryMatrix interface:
BinaryMatrix.get(row, col) returns the element of the matrix at index (row, col)
(0-indexed).
BinaryMatrix.dimensions() returns a list of 2 elements [rows, cols], which means

Description
    Given the array candies and the integer extraCandies, where candies[i]
    represents the number of candies that the ith kid has.
 1431. Kids With the Greatest Number of Candies
    
        For each kid check if there is a way to distribute extraCandies among the kids
    such that he or she can have the greatest number of candies among them. Notice
    that multiple kids can have the greatest number of candies.
Example 1:
    Input: candies = [2,3,5,1,3], extraCandies = 3
    Output: [true,true,true,false,true]
    Explanation:
    Kid 1 has 2 candies and if he or she receives all extra candies (3) will have 5
    candies --- the greatest number of candies among the kids.
    Kid 2 has 3 candies and if he or she receives at least 2 extra candies will have
    the greatest number of candies among the kids.
    Kid 3 has 5 candies and this is already the greatest number of candies among the
    kids.
    Kid 4 has 1 candy and even if he or she receives all extra candies will only
    have 4 candies.
    Kid 5 has 3 candies and if he or she receives at least 2 extra candies will have
    the greatest number of candies among the kids.
    Example 2:
    Input: candies = [4,2,1,1,2], extraCandies = 1
    Output: [true,false,false,false,false]
    Explanation: There is only 1 extra candy, therefore only kid 1 will have the
    greatest number of candies among the kids regardless of who takes the extra
    candy.
    Example 3:
    Input: candies = [12,1,12], extraCandies = 10
    Output: [true,false,true]
    Constraints:
    2 <= candies.length <= 100
    1 <= candies[i] <= 100
    1 <= extraCandies <= 50
Solution
05/02/2020:

    int n = candies.size();
    vector<bool> ret(n, false);
    for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      ret[i] = candies[i] + extraCandies >= max_val;

    finished it at time endTime[i].
    Return the number of students doing their homework at time queryTime. More
    formally, return the number of students where queryTime lays in the interval
    [startTime[i], endTime[i]] inclusive.
Example 1:
    Input: startTime = [1,2,3], endTime = [3,2,7], queryTime = 4
    Output: 1
    Explanation: We have 3 students where:
    The first student started doing homework at time 1 and finished at time 3 and
    wasn't doing anything at time 4.
    The second student started doing homework at time 2 and finished at time 2 and
    also wasn't doing anything at time 4.
    The third student started doing homework at time 3 and finished at time 7 and

 1460. Make Two Arrays Equal by Reversing Sub-arrays
Description
    Given two integer arrays of equal length target and arr.

        In one step, you can select any non-empty sub-array of arr and reverse it. You
    are allowed to make any number of steps.
    Return True if you can make arr equal to target, or False otherwise.
Example 1:
    Input: target = [1,2,3,4], arr = [2,4,1,3]
    Output: true
    Explanation: You can follow the next steps to convert arr to target:
    1- Reverse sub-array [2,4,1], arr becomes [1,4,2,3]
    2- Reverse sub-array [4,2], arr becomes [1,2,4,3]
    3- Reverse sub-array [4,3], arr becomes [1,2,3,4]
    There are multiple ways to convert arr to target, this is not the only way to do
    so.
    Example 2:
    Input: target = [7], arr = [7]
    Output: true
    Explanation: arr is equal to target without any reverses.
    Example 3:
    Input: target = [1,12], arr = [12,1]
    Output: true
    Example 4:
    Input: target = [3,7,9], arr = [3,7,11]
    Output: false
    Explanation: arr doesn't have value 9 and it can never be converted to target.
    Example 5:
    Input: target = [1,1,1,1,1], arr = [1,1,1,1,1]
    Output: true
    Constraints:
    target.length == arr.length
    1 <= target.length <= 1000
    1 <= target[i] <= 1000
    1 <= arr[i] <= 1000

Output: 12
Explanation: If you choose the indices i=1 and j=2 (indexed from 0), you will
get the maximum value, that is, (nums[1]-1)*(nums[2]-1) = (4-1)*(5-1) = 3*4 =
12.
Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,5,4,5]
Output: 16
Explanation: Choosing the indices i=1 and j=3 (indexed from 0), you will get the
maximum value of (5-1)*(5-1) = 16.

    vertical cut.
    Return the maximum area of a piece of cake after you cut at each horizontal and
    vertical position provided in the arrays horizontalCuts and verticalCuts. Since
    the answer can be a huge number, return this modulo 10^9 + 7.
Example 1:
    Input: h = 5, w = 4, horizontalCuts = [1,2,4], verticalCuts = [1,3]
    Output: 4
    Explanation: The figure above represents the given rectangular cake. Red lines
    are the horizontal and vertical cuts. After you cut the cake, the green piece of
    cake has the maximum area.
Example 2:
    Input: h = 5, w = 4, horizontalCuts = [3,1], verticalCuts = [1]
    Output: 6
    Explanation: The figure above represents the given rectangular cake. Red lines
    are the horizontal and vertical cuts. After you cut the cake, the green and
    yellow pieces of cake have the maximum area.
    
   Example 3:
Input: h = 5, w = 4, horizontalCuts = [3], verticalCuts = [3]
Output: 9
Constraints:

 1475. Final Prices With a Special Discount in a Shop
Description
    Given the array prices where prices[i] is the price of the ith item in a shop.
There is a special discount for items in the shop, if you buy the ith item, then
you will receive a discount equivalent to prices[j] where j is the minimum index
such that j > i and prices[j] <= prices[i], otherwise, you will not receive any
discount at all.
Return an array where the ith element is the final price you will pay for the
ith item of the shop considering the special discount.
Example 1:
Input: prices = [8,4,6,2,3]
Output: [4,2,4,2,3]
Explanation:
For item 0 with price[0]=8 you will receive a discount equivalent to
prices[1]=4, therefore, the final price you will pay is 8 - 4 = 4.
For item 1 with price[1]=4 you will receive a discount equivalent to
prices[3]=2, therefore, the final price you will pay is 4 - 2 = 2.
For item 2 with price[2]=6 you will receive a discount equivalent to
prices[3]=2, therefore, the final price you will pay is 6 - 2 = 4.
For items 3 and 4 you will not receive any discount at all.
Example 2:
Input: prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [1,2,3,4,5]
Explanation: In this case, for all items, you will not receive any discount at
all.

 111. Minimum Depth of Binary Tree
 Description
   Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.

       The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root
    node down to the nearest leaf node.
    Note: A leaf is a node with no children.
    Example:
    Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7],
3 /\ 9 20
/\ 15 7
    return its minimum depth = 2.

559. Maximum Depth of N-ary Tree
     Given a n-ary tree, find its maximum depth.
The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root
node down to the farthest leaf node.

each group of children is separated by the null value (See examples).
Example 1:
Input: root = [1,null,3,2,4,null,5,6]

563. Binary Tree Tilt
     Given a binary tree, return the tilt of the whole tree.
The tilt of a tree node is defined as the absolute difference between the sum of
all left subtree node values and the sum of all right subtree node values. Null
node has tilt 0.
The tilt of the whole tree is defined as the sum of all nodes' tilt.

 617. Merge Two Binary Trees
    Given two binary trees and imagine that when you put one of them to cover the
other, some nodes of the two trees are overlapped while the others are not.
You need to merge them into a new binary tree. The merge rule is that if two
nodes overlap, then sum node values up as the new value of the merged node.
Otherwise, the NOT null node will be used as the node of new tree.
Example 1:
Input:
  Tree 1                     Tree 2
12
/\ /\ 32 13 /\\ 547
Output:

 655. Print Binary Tree
 Description
   Print a binary tree in an m*n 2D string array following these rules:
The row number m should be equal to the height of the given binary tree.
The column number n should always be an odd number.

    The root node's value (in string format) should be put in the exactly middle of
the first row it can be put. The column and the row where the root node belongs
will separate the rest space into two parts (left-bottom part and right-bottom
part). You should print the left subtree in the left-bottom part and print the
right subtree in the right-bottom part. The left-bottom part and the right-
bottom part should have the same size. Even if one subtree is none while the
other is not, you don't need to print anything for the none subtree but still
need to leave the space as large as that for the other subtree. However, if two
subtrees are none, then you don't need to leave space for both of them.
Each unused space should contain an empty string "".
Print the subtrees following the same rules.
Example 1:
Input: 1
/ 2
Output:
[["", "1", ""],
 ["2", "", ""]]
Example 2:
Input: 1
/\ 23

Output:

700. Search in a Binary Search Tree
    
         Given the root node of a binary search tree (BST) and a value. You need to find
    the node in the BST that the node's value equals the given value. Return the
    subtree rooted with that node. If such node doesn't exist, you should return
    NULL.
For example,
    Given the tree:
            4
/\ 27
/\ 13
    And the value to search: 2
    You should return this subtree:
2 /\ 13
    In the example above, if we want to search the value 5, since there is no node
    with value 5, we should return NULL.
    Note that an empty tree is represented by NULL, therefore you would see the
    expected output (serialized tree format) as [], not null.

of those leaves form a leaf value sequence.
For example, in the given tree above, the leaf value sequence is (6, 7, 4, 9,
8).
Two binary trees are considered leaf-similar if their leaf value sequence is the
same.
Return true if and only if the two given trees with head nodes root1 and root2
are leaf-similar.
Note:
Both of the given trees will have between 1 and 100 nodes.

Description
993. Cousins in Binary Tree
     In a binary tree, the root node is at depth 0, and children of each depth k node
are at depth k+1.
Two nodes of a binary tree are cousins if they have the same depth, but have
different parents.
We are given the root of a binary tree with unique values, and the values x and
y of two different nodes in the tree.
Return true if and only if the nodes corresponding to the values x and y are
cousins.
Example 1:
Input: root = [1,2,3,4], x = 4, y = 3
Output: false
Example 2:
Input: root = [1,2,3,null,4,null,5], x = 5, y = 4
Output: true
Example 3:

       Input: root = [1,2,3,null,4], x = 2, y = 3
    Output: false
Note:
    The number of nodes in the tree will be between 2 and 100.
    Each node has a unique integer value from 1 to 100.
Solution
05/09/2020 Discussion:
We can create a new data structure Node to store the parent, depth of each node.
     class Node {
public:
  TreeNode* node;
  TreeNode* parent;
  int depth;
  Node(TreeNode* n, TreeNode* p, int d) : node(n), parent(p), depth(d) {};
};
 Then apply the standard BFS to search for x and y, then check the conditions of being cousins nodes. BFS:
    class Solution {
    public:
      bool isCousins(TreeNode* root, int x, int y) {
        Node nx = bfs(root, x);
        Node ny = bfs(root, y);
        return nx.parent != ny.parent && nx.depth == ny.depth;
}
      Node bfs(TreeNode* root, int x) {
        queue<Node> q;
        q.emplace(root, nullptr, 0);
        while (!q.empty()) {
          int n = q.size();
          for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            Node cur = q.front(); q.pop();
            if (cur.node->val == x) return cur;
            if (cur.node->left) q.emplace(cur.node->left, cur.node, cur.depth + 1);
            if (cur.node->right) q.emplace(cur.node->right, cur.node, cur.depth +
   1);

   } }
        return Node(nullptr, nullptr, -1);
      }
};
Since we store the information about the depth of each node, it doesn't really matter whether we search in level-order. Thus the code can be simplified to the following: Non-recursive DFS:
    class Solution {
public:
  bool isCousins(TreeNode* root, int x, int y) {
    Node nx = dfs(root, x);
    Node ny = dfs(root, y);
    return nx.parent != ny.parent && nx.depth == ny.depth;
}
  Node dfs(TreeNode* root, int x) {
    stack<Node> st;
    st.emplace(root, nullptr, 0);
    while (!st.empty()) {
      Node cur = st.top(); st.pop();
      if (cur.node->val == x) return cur;
      if (cur.node->left) st.emplace(cur.node->left, cur.node, cur.depth + 1);
      if (cur.node->right) st.emplace(cur.node->right, cur.node, cur.depth + 1);
}
    return Node(nullptr, nullptr, -1);
  }
};
 Recursive DFS:
    class Solution {
    public:
      bool isCousins(TreeNode* root, int x, int y) {
        Node nx = dfs(Node(root, nullptr, 0), x);
        Node ny = dfs(Node(root, nullptr, 0), y);
        return nx.parent != ny.parent && nx.depth == ny.depth;
}
      Node dfs(Node root, int x) {
        if (root.node == nullptr) return Node(nullptr, nullptr, -1);
        if (root.node->val == x) return root;
        Node left = dfs(Node(root.node->left, root.node, root.depth + 1), x);
        Node right = dfs(Node(root.node->right, root.node, root.depth + 1), x);
        if (left.node) return left;
        if (right.node) return right;
   
            return Node(nullptr, nullptr, -1);
      }
};
DFS without using Node:
    class Solution {
public:
  bool isCousins(TreeNode* root, int x, int y) {
    pair<TreeNode*, int> nx = dfs(root, nullptr, x, 0);
    pair<TreeNode*, int> ny = dfs(root, nullptr, y, 0);
    return nx.first != ny.first && nx.second == ny.second;
}
  pair<TreeNode*, int> dfs(TreeNode* root, TreeNode* parent, int x, int depth) {
    if (root == nullptr) return {nullptr, -1};
    if (root->val == x) return {parent, depth};
    pair<TreeNode*, int> left = dfs(root->left, root, x, depth + 1);
    pair<TreeNode*, int> right = dfs(root->right, root, x, depth + 1);
    if (left.first) return left;
    if (right.first) return right;
    return {nullptr, -1};
} };
 Or we can directly check the parents of the nodes on each level: BFS without using Node:
    class Solution {
    public:
      bool isCousins(TreeNode* root, int x, int y) {
        queue<pair<TreeNode*, int>> q;
        q.emplace(root, -1);
        while (!q.empty()) {
          int n = q.size();
          unordered_map<int, int> parent;
          for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            pair<TreeNode*, int> cur = q.front(); q.pop();
            parent[cur.first->val] = cur.second;
            if (cur.first->left != nullptr) q.emplace(cur.first->left, cur.first-
    >val);
            if (cur.first->right != nullptr) q.emplace(cur.first->right, cur.first-
>val); }
          if (parent.count(x) > 0 && parent.count(y) > 0 && parent[x] != parent[y])
    return true;
        }
        return false;
   
   } };
1008. Construct Binary Search Tree from Preorder Traversal
Description
     Return the root node of a binary search tree that matches the given preorder
traversal.
(Recall that a binary search tree is a binary tree where for every node, any
descendant of node.left has a value < node.val, and any descendant of node.right
has a value > node.val.  Also recall that a preorder traversal displays the
value of the node first, then traverses node.left, then traverses node.right.)
It's guaranteed that for the given test cases there is always possible to find a
binary search tree with the given requirements.
Example 1:
Input: [8,5,1,7,10,12]
Output: [8,5,10,1,7,null,12]
Constraints:
1 <= preorder.length <= 100
1 <= preorder[i] <= 10^8

Description
1022. Sum of Root To Leaf Binary Numbers
     Given a binary tree, each node has value 0 or 1.  Each root-to-leaf path
represents a binary number starting with the most significant bit.  For example,
if the path is 0 -> 1 -> 1 -> 0 -> 1, then this could represent 01101 in binary,
which is 13.
For all leaves in the tree, consider the numbers represented by the path from
the root to that leaf.
Return the sum of these numbers.
Example 1:
Input: [1,0,1,0,1,0,1]
Output: 22
Explanation: (100) + (101) + (110) + (111) = 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 22
Note:

   The number of nodes in the tree is between 1 and 1000.
node.val is 0 or 1.
The answer will not exceed 2^31 - 1.

 1325. Delete Leaves With a Given Value
 Description
   Given a binary tree root and an integer target, delete all the leaf nodes with
value target.
Note that once you delete a leaf node with value target, if it's parent node
becomes a leaf node and has the value target, it should also be deleted (you
need to continue doing that until you can't).

   Example 1:
    Input: root = [1,2,3,2,null,2,4], target = 2
    Output: [1,null,3,null,4]
    Explanation: Leaf nodes in green with value (target = 2) are removed (Picture in
    left).
    After removing, new nodes become leaf nodes with value (target = 2) (Picture in
    center).
    Example 2:
    Input: root = [1,3,3,3,2], target = 3
    Output: [1,3,null,null,2]
    Example 3:
    Input: root = [1,2,null,2,null,2], target = 2
    Output: [1]
    Explanation: Leaf nodes in green with value (target = 2) are removed at each
    step.
    Example 4:
    Input: root = [1,1,1], target = 1
    Output: []
    Example 5:
    Input: root = [1,2,3], target = 1
    Output: [1,2,3]
    Constraints:
    1 <= target <= 1000
    Each tree has at most 3000 nodes.

1333. Filter Restaurants by Vegan-Friendly, Price and Distance
Description
    Given the array restaurants where  restaurants[i] = [idi, ratingi,
    veganFriendlyi, pricei, distancei]. You have to filter the restaurants using
    three filters.
    The veganFriendly filter will be either true (meaning you should only include
    restaurants with veganFriendlyi set to true) or false (meaning you can include
    any restaurant). In addition, you have the filters maxPrice and maxDistance
    which are the maximum value for price and distance of restaurants you should
    consider respectively.
    Return the array of restaurant IDs after filtering, ordered by rating from
    highest to lowest. For restaurants with the same rating, order them by id from
    highest to lowest. For simplicity veganFriendlyi and veganFriendly take value 1
    when it is true, and 0 when it is false.
Example 1:
    Input: restaurants = [[1,4,1,40,10],[2,8,0,50,5],[3,8,1,30,4],[4,10,0,10,3],
    [5,1,1,15,1]], veganFriendly = 1, maxPrice = 50, maxDistance = 10
    Output: [3,1,5]
    Explanation:
     
       The restaurants are:
    Restaurant 1 [id=1, rating=4, veganFriendly=1, price=40, distance=10]
    Restaurant 2 [id=2, rating=8, veganFriendly=0, price=50, distance=5]
    Restaurant 3 [id=3, rating=8, veganFriendly=1, price=30, distance=4]
    Restaurant 4 [id=4, rating=10, veganFriendly=0, price=10, distance=3]
    Restaurant 5 [id=5, rating=1, veganFriendly=1, price=15, distance=1]
    After filter restaurants with veganFriendly = 1, maxPrice = 50 and maxDistance =
    10 we have restaurant 3, restaurant 1 and restaurant 5 (ordered by rating from
    highest to lowest).
    Example 2:
    Input: restaurants = [[1,4,1,40,10],[2,8,0,50,5],[3,8,1,30,4],[4,10,0,10,3],
    [5,1,1,15,1]], veganFriendly = 0, maxPrice = 50, maxDistance = 10
    Output: [4,3,2,1,5]
    Explanation: The restaurants are the same as in example 1, but in this case the
    filter veganFriendly = 0, therefore all restaurants are considered.
Example 3:
    Input: restaurants = [[1,4,1,40,10],[2,8,0,50,5],[3,8,1,30,4],[4,10,0,10,3],
    [5,1,1,15,1]], veganFriendly = 0, maxPrice = 30, maxDistance = 3
    Output: [4,5]
    Constraints:
    1 <= restaurants.length <= 10^4
    restaurants[i].length == 5
    1 <= idi, ratingi, pricei, distancei <= 10^5
    1 <= maxPrice, maxDistance <= 10^5
    veganFriendlyi and veganFriendly are 0 or 1.

 1443. Minimum Time to Collect All Apples in a Tree
Description
 
    Given an undirected tree consisting of n vertices numbered from 0 to n-1, which
has some apples in their vertices. You spend 1 second to walk over one edge of
the tree. Return the minimum time in seconds you have to spend in order to
collect all apples in the tree starting at vertex 0 and coming back to this
vertex.
The edges of the undirected tree are given in the array edges, where edges[i] =
[fromi, toi] means that exists an edge connecting the vertices fromi and toi.
Additionally, there is a boolean array hasApple, where hasApple[i] = true means
that vertex i has an apple, otherwise, it does not have any apple.

 1448. Count Good Nodes in Binary Tree
 Description
   Given a binary tree root, a node X in the tree is named good if in the path from
root to X there are no nodes with a value greater than X.
Return the number of good nodes in the binary tree.
Example 1:
Input: root = [3,1,4,3,null,1,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Nodes in blue are good.
Root Node (3) is always a good node.
Node 4 -> (3,4) is the maximum value in the path starting from the root.
Node 5 -> (3,4,5) is the maximum value in the path
Node 3 -> (3,1,3) is the maximum value in the path.
Example 2:
Input: root = [3,3,null,4,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: Node 2 -> (3, 3, 2) is not good, because "3" is higher than it.
Example 3:
Input: root = [1]
Output: 1
Explanation: Root is considered as good.
Constraints:
The number of nodes in the binary tree is in the range [1, 10^5].
Each node's value is between [-10^4, 10^4].

Description
    Given a binary tree where node values are digits from 1 to 9. A path in the
    binary tree is said to be pseudo-palindromic if at least one permutation of the
    node values in the path is a palindrome.
    Return the number of pseudo-palindromic paths going from the root node to leaf
    nodes.
Example 1:
    Input: root = [2,3,1,3,1,null,1]
    Output: 2
    Explanation: The figure above represents the given binary tree. There are three
    paths going from the root node to leaf nodes: the red path [2,3,3], the green
    path [2,1,1], and the path [2,3,1]. Among these paths only red path and green
    path are pseudo-palindromic paths since the red path [2,3,3] can be rearranged
    in [3,2,3] (palindrome) and the green path [2,1,1] can be rearranged in [1,2,1]
    (palindrome).
    Example 2:

  1469. Find All The Lonely Nodes
 Description
    In a binary tree, a lonely node is a node that is the only child of its parent
    node. The root of the tree is not lonely because it does not have a parent node.
    Given the root of a binary tree, return an array containing the values of all
    lonely nodes in the tree. Return the list in any order.
Example 1:
    Input: root = [1,2,3,null,4]
    Output: [4]
    Explanation: Light blue node is the only lonely node.
    Node 1 is the root and is not lonely.
    Nodes 2 and 3 have the same parent and are not lonely.
    Example 2:
    Input: root = [7,1,4,6,null,5,3,null,null,null,null,null,2]
    Output: [6,2]
    Explanation: Light blue nodes are lonely nodes.
    Please remember that order doesn't matter, [2,6] is also an acceptable answer.
    Example 3:
    Input: root = [11,99,88,77,null,null,66,55,null,null,44,33,null,null,22]
    Output: [77,55,33,66,44,22]
    Explanation: Nodes 99 and 88 share the same parent. Node 11 is the root.
    All other nodes are lonely.
Example 4:
    Input: root = [197]
    Output: []
    Example 5:
    Input: root = [31,null,78,null,28]
    Output: [78,28]
    Constraints:
    The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 1000].
   
   Each node's value is between [1, 10^6].

2. Add Two Numbers
 Description

    You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.
The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single
digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.
You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the
number 0 itself.
Example:
Input: (2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)
Output: 7 -> 0 -> 8
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.
 Solution
01/25/2020:
   /**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
* int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(NULL) {}

      if (l2) carry += l2->val, l2 = l2->next;
      cur->next = new ListNode(carry % 10);
}
    return pre->next;
  }
};
 7. Reverse Integer
 Description
   Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.
Example 1:

   Input: 123
Output: 321
Example 2:
Input: -123
Output: -321
Example 3:
Input: 120
Output: 21
Note:
Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within
the 32-bit signed integer range: [−231,  231 − 1]. For the purpose of this
problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer
overflows.
 Solution
01/29/2020:
   class Solution {
public:
  int reverse(int x) {
    string s = x > 0 ? to_string(x) : to_string(-(long)x);
    while (s.size() > 1 && s.back() == '0') s.pop_back();
    std::reverse(s.begin(), s.end());
    try {
      return x > 0 ? stoi(s) : -1 * stoi(s);
    } catch(std::out_of_range& e) {
return 0; }
} };
 9. Palindrome Number
 Description
   Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome when it
reads the same backward as forward.
Example 1:
Input: 121

   Output: true
Example 2:
Input: -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes
121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
Example 3:
Input: 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
Follow up:
Coud you solve it without converting the integer to a string?
 Solution
01/29/2020:
   class Solution {
public:
  bool isPalindrome(int x) {
    if (x < 0) return false;
    string s = to_string(x);
    for (int l = 0, r = s.size() - 1; l < r; ++l, --r)
      if (s[l] != s[r]) return false;
    return true;
} };
 136. Single Number
 Description
   Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears twice except for one.
Find that single one.
Note:
Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it
without using extra memory?
Example 1:

       Input: [2,2,1]
    Output: 1
    Example 2:
    Input: [4,1,2,1,2]
    Output: 4
Solution
02/03/2020:
    class Solution {
public:
  int singleNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
    int ret = 0;
    for (auto& n : nums) {
ret ^= n; }
return ret; }
};
 Description
172. Factorial Trailing Zeroes
    Given an integer n, return the number of trailing zeroes in n!.
Example 1:
Input: 3
Output: 0
Explanation: 3! = 6, no trailing zero.
Example 2:
Input: 5
Output: 1
Explanation: 5! = 120, one trailing zero.
Note: Your solution should be in logarithmic time complexity.
 Solution
05/20/2020:

    class Solution {
public:
  int trailingZeroes(int n) {
    int ret = 0;
    for (; n >= 5; ret += n / 5, n /= 5);
    return ret;
} };
    class Solution {
public:
  int trailingZeroes(int n) {
    if (n < 5) return 0;
    return n / 5 + trailingZeroes(n / 5);
} };
 202. Happy Number
 Description
   Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy".
A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any
positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits,
and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it
loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which
this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.
Example:
Input: 19
Output: true
Explanation:
12 + 92 = 82
82 + 22 = 68
62 + 82 = 100
12 + 02 + 02 = 1
 Solution
01/26/2020:

    class Solution {
public:
  bool isHappy(int n) {
    unordered_set<int> s;
    for (int sum = 0; s.find(n) == s.end(); n = sum, sum = 0) {
      s.insert(n);
      for (; n > 0; n /= 10)
        sum += (n % 10) * (n % 10);
    }
    return s.find(1) != s.end();
  }
};
 217. Contains Duplicate
 Description
   Given an array of integers, find if the array contains any duplicates.
Your function should return true if any value appears at least twice in the
array, and it should return false if every element is distinct.
Example 1:
Input: [1,2,3,1]
Output: true
Example 2:
Input: [1,2,3,4]
Output: false
Example 3:
Input: [1,1,1,3,3,4,3,2,4,2]
Output: true
 Solution
05/17/2020:

    class Solution {
public:
  bool containsDuplicate(vector<int>& nums) {
    unordered_set<int> s;
    for (auto& n : nums) {
      if (s.count(n) > 0) {
        return true;
}
      s.insert(n);
    }
    return false;
  }
};
    class Solution {
public:
  bool containsDuplicate(vector<int>& nums) {
    unordered_map<int, int> mp;
    for (auto& n : nums)
      if (++mp[n] > 1)
        return true;
    return false;
  }
};
 258. Add Digits
 Description
   Given a non-negative integer num, repeatedly add all its digits until the result
has only one digit.
Example:
Input: 38
Output: 2
Explanation: The process is like: 3 + 8 = 11, 1 + 1 = 2.
             Since 2 has only one digit, return it.
Could you do it without any loop/recursion in O(1) runtime?
Follow up:
 Solution
05/23/2020:

    class Solution {
public:
  int addDigits(int num) {
    int ret = num;
    while (ret > 9) {
      for (ret = 0; num != 0; ret += num % 10, num /= 10);
num = ret; }
return ret; }
};
 263. Ugly Number
 Description
   Write a program to check whether a given number is an ugly number.
Ugly numbers are positive numbers whose prime factors only include 2, 3, 5.
Example 1:
Input: 6
Output: true
Explanation: 6 = 2 × 3
Example 2:
Input: 8
Output: true
Explanation: 8 = 2 × 2 × 2
Example 3:
Input: 14
Output: false
Explanation: 14 is not ugly since it includes another prime factor 7.
Note:
1 is typically treated as an ugly number.
Input is within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−231,  231 − 1].
 Solution
05/23/2020:

    class Solution {
public:
  bool isUgly(int num) {
    if (num <= 0) return false;
    while (num % 2 == 0) num /= 2;
    while (num % 3 == 0) num /= 3;
    while (num % 5 == 0) num /= 5;
    return num == 1;
} };
 476. Number Complement
 Description
   Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement strategy
is to flip the bits of its binary representation.
Note:
The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed
integer.
You could assume no leading zero bit in the integer’s binary representation.
Example 1:
Input: 5
Output: 2
Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and
its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.
Example 2:
Input: 1
Output: 0
Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its
complement is 0. So you need to output 0.

645. Set Mismatch
 Description
   The set S originally contains numbers from 1 to n. But unfortunately, due to the
data error, one of the numbers in the set got duplicated to another number in
the set, which results in repetition of one number and loss of another number.
Given an array nums representing the data status of this set after the error.
Your task is to firstly find the number occurs twice and then find the number
that is missing. Return them in the form of an array.
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,2,4]
Output: [2,3]
Note:
The given array size will in the range [2, 10000].
The given array's numbers won't have any order.

728. Self Dividing Numbers
     A self-dividing number is a number that is divisible by every digit it contains.
For example, 128 is a self-dividing number because 128 % 1 == 0, 128 % 2 == 0,
and 128 % 8 == 0.
Also, a self-dividing number is not allowed to contain the digit zero.
Given a lower and upper number bound, output a list of every possible self
dividing number, including the bounds if possible.
Example 1:
Input:
left = 1, right = 22
Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 15, 22]
Note:
The boundaries of each input argument are 1 <= left <= right <= 10000.

 883. Projection Area of 3D Shapes
 Description
   On a N * N grid, we place some 1 * 1 * 1 cubes that are axis-aligned with the x,
y, and z axes.
Each value v = grid[i][j] represents a tower of v cubes placed on top of grid
cell (i, j).
Now we view the projection of these cubes onto the xy, yz, and zx planes.
A projection is like a shadow, that maps our 3 dimensional figure to a 2
dimensional plane.
Here, we are viewing the "shadow" when looking at the cubes from the top, the
front, and the side.
Return the total area of all three projections.
Example 1:
Input: [[2]]
Output: 5
Example 2:
Input: [[1,2],[3,4]]
Output: 17
Explanation:
Here are the three projections ("shadows") of the shape made with each axis-
aligned plane.
Example 3:
Input: [[1,0],[0,2]]

Return a list of all powerful integers that have value less than or equal to
bound.
You may return the answer in any order.  In your answer, each value should occur

     We distribute some number of candies, to a row of n = num_people people in the
following way:
We then give 1 candy to the first person, 2 candies to the second person, and so
on until we give n candies to the last person.
Then, we go back to the start of the row, giving n + 1 candies to the first
person, n + 2 candies to the second person, and so on until we give 2 * n
candies to the last person.
This process repeats (with us giving one more candy each time, and moving to the
start of the row after we reach the end) until we run out of candies.  The last
person will receive all of our remaining candies (not necessarily one more than
the previous gift).
Return an array (of length num_people and sum candies) that represents the final
distribution of candies.
Example 1:

       Input: candies = 7, num_people = 4
    Output: [1,2,3,1]
    Explanation:
    On the first turn, ans[0] += 1, and the array is [1,0,0,0].
    On the second turn, ans[1] += 2, and the array is [1,2,0,0].
    On the third turn, ans[2] += 3, and the array is [1,2,3,0].
    On the fourth turn, ans[3] += 1 (because there is only one candy left), and the
    final array is [1,2,3,1].
Example 2:
    Input: candies = 10, num_people = 3
    Output: [5,2,3]
    Explanation:
    On the first turn, ans[0] += 1, and the array is [1,0,0].
    On the second turn, ans[1] += 2, and the array is [1,2,0].

 1237. Find Positive Integer Solution for a Given Equation
Description
    Given a function  f(x, y) and a value z, return all positive integer pairs x and
    y where f(x,y) == z.
    The function is constantly increasing, i.e.:
    f(x, y) < f(x + 1, y)
    f(x, y) < f(x, y + 1)
    The function interface is defined like this:
    interface CustomFunction {
    public:
      // Returns positive integer f(x, y) for any given positive integer x and y.
      int f(int x, int y);
    };
    
       For custom testing purposes you're given an integer function_id and a target z
    as input, where function_id represent one function from an secret internal list,
    on the examples you'll know only two functions from the list.
    You may return the solutions in any order.
Example 1:
    Input: function_id = 1, z = 5
    Output: [[1,4],[2,3],[3,2],[4,1]]
    Explanation: function_id = 1 means that f(x, y) = x + y
    Example 2:
    Input: function_id = 2, z = 5
    Output: [[1,5],[5,1]]
    Explanation: function_id = 2 means that f(x, y) = x * y
    Constraints:
    1 <= function_id <= 9
    1 <= z <= 100
    It's guaranteed that the solutions of f(x, y) == z will be on the range 1 <= x,

 1295. Find Numbers with Even Number of Digits
Description
    Given an array nums of integers, return how many of them contain an even number
of digits.
Example 1:
Input: nums = [12,345,2,6,7896]
Output: 2
Explanation:
12 contains 2 digits (even number of digits).
345 contains 3 digits (odd number of digits).
2 contains 1 digit (odd number of digits).
6 contains 1 digit (odd number of digits).
7896 contains 4 digits (even number of digits).
Therefore only 12 and 7896 contain an even number of digits.
Example 2:
Input: nums = [555,901,482,1771]
Output: 1
Explanation:
Only 1771 contains an even number of digits.
Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 500
1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5

 Description
1323. Maximum 69 Number
    Given a positive integer num consisting only of digits 6 and 9.
Return the maximum number you can get by changing at most one digit (6 becomes
9, and 9 becomes 6).
Example 1:
Input: num = 9669
Output: 9969
Explanation:
Changing the first digit results in 6669.
Changing the second digit results in 9969.
Changing the third digit results in 9699.
Changing the fourth digit results in 9666.
The maximum number is 9969.
Example 2:
Input: num = 9996
Output: 9999
Explanation: Changing the last digit 6 to 9 results in the maximum number.
Example 3:

 58. Length of Last Word
 Description

    Given a string s consists of upper/lower-case alphabets and empty space
characters ' ', return the length of last word (last word means the last
appearing word if we loop from left to right) in the string.
If the last word does not exist, return 0.
Note: A word is defined as a maximal substring consisting of non-space
characters only.
Example:
Input: "Hello World"
Output: 5
 Solution
05/27/2020:
   class Solution {
public:
  int lengthOfLastWord(string s) {
    if (s.empty()) return 0;
    string ss, last;
    istringstream iss(s);
    while (getline(iss, ss, ' '))
      if (!ss.empty())
        last = ss;
    return last.size();
} };
 71. Simplify Path
 Description
   Given an absolute path for a file (Unix-style), simplify it. Or in other words,
convert it to the canonical path.
In a UNIX-style file system, a period . refers to the current directory.
Furthermore, a double period .. moves the directory up a level.
Note that the returned canonical path must always begin with a slash /, and
there must be only a single slash / between two directory names. The last
directory name (if it exists) must not end with a trailing /. Also, the
canonical path must be the shortest string representing the absolute path.

   Example 1:
    Input: "/home/"
    Output: "/home"
    Explanation: Note that there is no trailing slash after the last directory name.
    Example 2:
    Input: "/../"
    Output: "/"
    Explanation: Going one level up from the root directory is a no-op, as the root
    level is the highest level you can go.
    Example 3:
    Input: "/home//foo/"
    Output: "/home/foo"
    Explanation: In the canonical path, multiple consecutive slashes are replaced by
    a single one.
    Example 4:
    Input: "/a/./b/../../c/"
    Output: "/c"
    Example 5:
    Input: "/a/../../b/../c//.//"
    Output: "/c"
    Example 6:
    Input: "/a//b////c/d//././/.."
    Output: "/a/b/c"
Solution
05/27/2020:
    class Solution {
    public:
      string simplifyPath(string path) {
        stack<string> st;
        istringstream iss(path);
        string s;
        while (getline(iss, s, '/')) {
          if (s == "..") {
            if (!st.empty())
              st.pop();
    } else if (s.size() > 0 && s != ".") {

               st.push(s);
          }
        }
        string ret;
        while (!st.empty()) {
          ret = "/" + st.top() + ret;
st.pop(); }
        return ret.empty() ? "/" : ret;
      }
};
Description
 344. Reverse String
    Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array
of characters char[].
Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the
input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.
You may assume all the characters consist of printable ascii characters.
Example 1:
Input: ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
Example 2:
Input: ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]

 383. Ransom Note
 Description
   Given an arbitrary ransom note string and another string containing letters from
all the magazines, write a function that will return true if the ransom note can
be constructed from the magazines ; otherwise, it will return false.
Each letter in the magazine string can only be used once in your ransom note.
Note:
You may assume that both strings contain only lowercase letters.
canConstruct("a", "b") -> false
canConstruct("aa", "ab") -> false
canConstruct("aa", "aab") -> true
 Solution
05/04/2020:
   class Solution {

 557. Reverse Words in a String III
 
 Description
   Given a string, you need to reverse the order of characters in each word within
a sentence while still preserving whitespace and initial word order.
Example 1:
Input: "Let's take LeetCode contest"
Output: "s'teL ekat edoCteeL tsetnoc"
Note: In the string, each word is separated by single space and there will not
be any extra space in the string.
 Solution

      int j = i;
      for (; j < (int)s.size() && s[j] != ' '; ++j);
      t.push_back(s.substr(i, j - i));
      i = j;

return ret; }
};
 599. Minimum Index Sum of Two Lists
 Description
   Suppose Andy and Doris want to choose a restaurant for dinner, and they both
have a list of favorite restaurants represented by strings.
You need to help them find out their common interest with the least list index
sum. If there is a choice tie between answers, output all of them with no order
requirement. You could assume there always exists an answer.

    Example 1:
    Input:
    ["Shogun", "Tapioca Express", "Burger King", "KFC"]
    ["Piatti", "The Grill at Torrey Pines", "Hungry Hunter Steakhouse", "Shogun"]
    Output: ["Shogun"]
    Explanation: The only restaurant they both like is "Shogun".
    Example 2:
    Input:
    ["Shogun", "Tapioca Express", "Burger King", "KFC"]
    ["KFC", "Shogun", "Burger King"]
    Output: ["Shogun"]
    Explanation: The restaurant they both like and have the least index sum is
    "Shogun" with index sum 1 (0+1).
    Note:
    The length of both lists will be in the range of [1, 1000].
    The length of strings in both lists will be in the range of [1, 30].
    The index is starting from 0 to the list length minus 1.
    No duplicates in both lists.

    public:
      vector<string> findRestaurant(vector<string>& list1, vector<string>& list2) {
        if (list1.empty() || list2.empty()) return {};
        unordered_map<string, vector<int>> index;
        for (int i = 0; i < (int)list1.size(); ++i) index[list1[i]].push_back(i);
        for (int i = 0; i < (int)list2.size(); ++i) index[list2[i]].push_back(i);

 Description
657. Robot Return to Origin
    There is a robot starting at position (0, 0), the origin, on a 2D plane. Given a
sequence of its moves, judge if this robot ends up at (0, 0) after it completes
its moves.
The move sequence is represented by a string, and the character moves[i]
represents its ith move. Valid moves are R (right), L (left), U (up), and D
(down). If the robot returns to the origin after it finishes all of its moves,
return true. Otherwise, return false.
Note: The way that the robot is "facing" is irrelevant. "R" will always make the
robot move to the right once, "L" will always make it move left, etc. Also,
assume that the magnitude of the robot's movement is the same for each move.
Example 1:
Input: "UD"
Output: true
Explanation: The robot moves up once, and then down once. All moves have the
same magnitude, so it ended up at the origin where it started. Therefore, we
return true.
Example 2:
Input: "LL"
Output: false
Explanation: The robot moves left twice. It ends up two "moves" to the left of
the origin. We return false because it is not at the origin at the end of its
moves.
 Solution
01/30/2020:
    class Solution {
    public:
   bool judgeCircle(string moves) {
  int h = 0, v = 0;
  for (auto& m : moves) {

     Implement function ToLowerCase() that has a string parameter str, and returns
the same string in lowercase.
Example 1:
Input: "Hello"
Output: "hello"
Example 2:

return str; }
};
 771. Jewels and Stones
 Description
   You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels, and S
representing the stones you have.  Each character in S is a type of stone you
have.  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.
The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S are
letters. Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of
stone from "A".
Example 1:
Input: J = "aA", S = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3
Example 2:
Input: J = "z", S = "ZZ"
Output: 0
Note:
S and J will consist of letters and have length at most 50.
The characters in J are distinct.
 Solution
01/29/2020:

    class Solution {
public:
  int numJewelsInStones(string J, string S) {

 796. Rotate String
 Description
   We are given two strings, A and B.
A shift on A consists of taking string A and moving the leftmost character to
the rightmost position. For example, if A = 'abcde', then it will be 'bcdea'
after one shift on A. Return True if and only if A can become B after some
number of shifts on A.
Example 1:
Input: A = 'abcde', B = 'cdeab'
Output: true
Example 2:
Input: A = 'abcde', B = 'abced'
Output: false
Note:
A and B will have length at most 100.
 Solution
06/16/2020:
    class Solution {
    public:
   bool rotateString(string A, string B) {

Description
 804. Unique Morse Code Words
    International Morse Code defines a standard encoding where each letter is mapped
to a series of dots and dashes, as follows: "a" maps to ".-", "b" maps to
"-...", "c" maps to "-.-.", and so on.
For convenience, the full table for the 26 letters of the English alphabet is
given below:
[".-","-...","-.-.","-..",".","..-.","--.","....","..",".---","-.-",".-..","--
","-.","---",".--.","--.-",".-.","...","-","..-","...-",".--","-..-","-.--","-
-.."]
Now, given a list of words, each word can be written as a concatenation of the
Morse code of each letter. For example, "cba" can be written as "-.-..--...",
(which is the concatenation "-.-." + "-..." + ".-"). We'll call such a
concatenation, the transformation of a word.
Return the number of different transformations among all words we have.
Example:
Input: words = ["gin", "zen", "gig", "msg"]
Output: 2
Explanation:
The transformation of each word is:
"gin" -> "--...-."
"zen" -> "--...-."
"gig" -> "--...--."
"msg" -> "--...--."
There are 2 different transformations, "--...-." and "--...--.".
Note:

   The length of words will be at most 100.
Each words[i] will have length in range [1, 12].
words[i] will only consist of lowercase letters.
 Solution
01/29/2020:
   class Solution {
public:
  int uniqueMorseRepresentations(vector<string>& words) {
    unordered_set<string> morse;
    vector<string> dict{".-","-...","-.-.","-..",".","..-.","-
-.","....","..",".---","-.-",".-..","--","-.","---",".--.","--.-",".-.","...","-
","..-","...-",".--","-..-","-.--","--.."};
    for (auto& w : words) {
      string s;
      for (auto& c : w) {

 806. Number of Lines To Write String
 Description
   We are to write the letters of a given string S, from left to right into lines.
Each line has maximum width 100 units, and if writing a letter would cause the
width of the line to exceed 100 units, it is written on the next line. We are
given an array widths, an array where widths[0] is the width of 'a', widths[1]
is the width of 'b', ..., and widths[25] is the width of 'z'.
Now answer two questions: how many lines have at least one character from S, and
what is the width used by the last such line? Return your answer as an integer
list of length 2.
Example :
Input:

       widths =
    [10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10]
    S = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
    Output: [3, 60]
    Explanation:
    All letters have the same length of 10. To write all 26 letters,
    we need two full lines and one line with 60 units.
    Example :
    Input:
    widths =
    [4,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10]
    S = "bbbcccdddaaa"
    Output: [2, 4]
    Explanation:
    All letters except 'a' have the same length of 10, and
    "bbbcccdddaa" will cover 9 * 10 + 2 * 4 = 98 units.
    For the last 'a', it is written on the second line because
    there is only 2 units left in the first line.
    So the answer is 2 lines, plus 4 units in the second line.
Note:
    The length of S will be in the range [1, 1000].
    S will only contain lowercase letters.
    widths is an array of length 26.
    widths[i] will be in the range of [2, 10].
Solution
02/03/2020:
    class Solution {
public:
  vector<int> numberOfLines(vector<int>& widths, string S) {
    int lines = S.size() > 0 ? 1 : 0, cur = 0;
    for (auto& c : S) {
      if (cur + widths[c - 'a'] > 100) {
        ++lines;
        cur = widths[c - 'a'];
      } else {
        cur += widths[c - 'a'];
      }
}
    return {lines, cur};
  }

 Description
821. Shortest Distance to a Character
    Given a string S and a character C, return an array of integers representing the
shortest distance from the character C in the string.
Example 1:
Input: S = "loveleetcode", C = 'e'
Output: [3, 2, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 1, 0]
Note:
S string length is in [1, 10000].
C is a single character, and guaranteed to be in string S.
All letters in S and C are lowercase.

  893. Groups of Special-Equivalent Strings
 Description
    You are given an array A of strings.
    A move onto S consists of swapping any two even indexed characters of S, or any
    two odd indexed characters of S.
    Two strings S and T are special-equivalent if after any number of moves onto S,
    S == T.
    For example, S = "zzxy" and T = "xyzz" are special-equivalent because we may
    make the moves "zzxy" -> "xzzy" -> "xyzz" that swap S[0] and S[2], then S[1] and
    S[3].
    Now, a group of special-equivalent strings from A is a non-empty subset of A
    such that:
    Every pair of strings in the group are special equivalent, and;
    The group is the largest size possible (ie., there isn't a string S not in the
    group such that S is special equivalent to every string in the group)
    Return the number of groups of special-equivalent strings from A.
Example 1:
    Input: ["abcd","cdab","cbad","xyzz","zzxy","zzyx"]
    Output: 3
    Explanation:
    One group is ["abcd", "cdab", "cbad"], since they are all pairwise special
    equivalent, and none of the other strings are all pairwise special equivalent to
    these.
    The other two groups are ["xyzz", "zzxy"] and ["zzyx"].  Note that in
    particular, "zzxy" is not special equivalent to "zzyx".
    Example 2:
    Input: ["abc","acb","bac","bca","cab","cba"]
    Output: 3
Note:
    1 <= A.length <= 1000
    1 <= A[i].length <= 20
    All A[i] have the same length.
    All A[i] consist of only lowercase letters.

public:
  int numSpecialEquivGroups(vector<string>& A) {
    unordered_set<string> us;
    for (auto& s : A) {
      vector<int> cnt(52, 0);
      for (int i = 0; i < (int)s.size(); ++i) {
        if (i % 2 == 0) {
          ++cnt[s[i] - 'a'];
        } else {
          ++cnt[s[i] - 'a' + 26];
} }
      string ss;
      for (auto& n : cnt) {
        if (n < 10) {
          ss += "0" + to_string(n);
        } else {
          ss += to_string(n);
} }
      us.insert(ss);
    }
    return us.size();
  }
};
 929. Unique Email Addresses
 Description
   Every email consists of a local name and a domain name, separated by the @ sign.
For example, in alice@leetcode.com, alice is the local name, and leetcode.com is
the domain name.
Besides lowercase letters, these emails may contain '.'s or '+'s.

       If you add periods ('.') between some characters in the local name part of an
    email address, mail sent there will be forwarded to the same address without
    dots in the local name.  For example, "alice.z@leetcode.com" and
    "alicez@leetcode.com" forward to the same email address.  (Note that this rule
    does not apply for domain names.)
    If you add a plus ('+') in the local name, everything after the first plus sign
    will be ignored. This allows certain emails to be filtered, for example
    m.y+name@email.com will be forwarded to my@email.com.  (Again, this rule does
    not apply for domain names.)
    It is possible to use both of these rules at the same time.
    Given a list of emails, we send one email to each address in the list.  How many
    different addresses actually receive mails?
Example 1:
    Input:
    ["test.email+alex@leetcode.com","test.e.mail+bob.cathy@leetcode.com","testemail+
    david@lee.tcode.com"]
    Output: 2
    Explanation: "testemail@leetcode.com" and "testemail@lee.tcode.com" actually
    receive mails
Note:
    1 <= emails[i].length <= 100
    1 <= emails.length <= 100
    Each emails[i] contains exactly one '@' character.
    All local and domain names are non-empty.
    Local names do not start with a '+' character.
Solution
01/30/2020:
    class Solution {
    public:
      int numUniqueEmails(vector<string>& emails) {

          unique_emails.insert(processEmail(email));
        }
    
   };
Description
953. Verifying an Alien Dictionary
  return unique_emails.size();
}
string processEmail(string& email) {
  string ret;
  bool isLocal = true, doNotIgnore = true;
  for (int i = 0; i < email.size(); ++i) {
    if (isLocal) {
      if (doNotIgnore) {
        if (email[i] == '+') {
          doNotIgnore = false;
        } else if (email[i] == '.') {
          continue;
        } else if (email[i] == '@') {
          ret.push_back(email[i]);
          isLocal = false;
          doNotIgnore = true;
        } else {
          ret.push_back(email[i]);

          doNotIgnore = true;
} }
    } else {
      ret.push_back(email[i]);
} }
return ret; }
     In an alien language, surprisingly they also use english lowercase letters, but
possibly in a different order. The order of the alphabet is some permutation of
lowercase letters.
Given a sequence of words written in the alien language, and the order of the
alphabet, return true if and only if the given words are sorted lexicographicaly
in this alien language.

   Example 1:
    Input: words = ["hello","leetcode"], order = "hlabcdefgijkmnopqrstuvwxyz"
    Output: true
    Explanation: As 'h' comes before 'l' in this language, then the sequence is
    sorted.
Example 2:
    Input: words = ["word","world","row"], order = "worldabcefghijkmnpqstuvxyz"
    Output: false
    Explanation: As 'd' comes after 'l' in this language, then words[0] > words[1],
    hence the sequence is unsorted.
Example 3:
    Input: words = ["apple","app"], order = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
    Output: false
    Explanation: The first three characters "app" match, and the second string is
    shorter (in size.) According to lexicographical rules "apple" > "app", because
    'l' > '∅', where '∅' is defined as the blank character which is less than any
    other character (More info).
    Constraints:
    1 <= words.length <= 100
    1 <= words[i].length <= 20
    order.length == 26
    All characters in words[i] and order are English lowercase letters.

    class Solution {
    public:
      bool isAlienSorted(vector<string>& words, string order) {
        vector<int> o(26, 0);

Description
1002. Find Common Characters
     Given an array A of strings made only from lowercase letters, return a list of
all characters that show up in all strings within the list (including
duplicates).  For example, if a character occurs 3 times in all strings but not
4 times, you need to include that character three times in the final answer.
You may return the answer in any order.
Example 1:
Input: ["bella","label","roller"]
Output: ["e","l","l"]
Example 2:
Input: ["cool","lock","cook"]
Output: ["c","o"]
Note:
1 <= A.length <= 100
1 <= A[i].length <= 100
A[i][j] is a lowercase letter

 Description
1021. Remove Outermost Parentheses
    A valid parentheses string is either empty (""), "(" + A + ")", or A + B, where
A and B are valid parentheses strings, and + represents string concatenation.
For example, "", "()", "(())()", and "(()(()))" are all valid parentheses
strings.
A valid parentheses string S is primitive if it is nonempty, and there does not
exist a way to split it into S = A+B, with A and B nonempty valid parentheses
strings.
Given a valid parentheses string S, consider its primitive decomposition: S =
P_1 + P_2 + ... + P_k, where P_i are primitive valid parentheses strings.
Return S after removing the outermost parentheses of every primitive string in
the primitive decomposition of S.

   Example 1:
    Input: "(()())(())"
    Output: "()()()"
    Explanation:
    The input string is "(()())(())", with primitive decomposition "(()())" + "
    (())".
    After removing outer parentheses of each part, this is "()()" + "()" = "()()()".
    Example 2:
    Input: "(()())(())(()(()))"
    Output: "()()()()(())"
    Explanation:
    The input string is "(()())(())(()(()))", with primitive decomposition "(()())"
    + "(())" + "(()(()))".
    After removing outer parentheses of each part, this is "()()" + "()" + "()(())"
    = "()()()()(())".
    Example 3:
    Input: "()()"
    Output: ""
    Explanation:
    The input string is "()()", with primitive decomposition "()" + "()".
    After removing outer parentheses of each part, this is "" + "" = "".
Note:
    S.length <= 10000
    S[i] is "(" or ")"
    S is a valid parentheses string
Solution
01/29/2020:
    class Solution {

1044. Longest Duplicate Substring
ret += c; }
} }
return ret; }
     Given a string S, consider all duplicated substrings: (contiguous) substrings of
S that occur 2 or more times.  (The occurrences may overlap.)
Return any duplicated substring that has the longest possible length.  (If S
does not have a duplicated substring, the answer is "".)
Example 1:
Input: "banana"
Output: "ana"
Example 2:
Input: "abcd"
Output: ""
Note:
2 <= S.length <= 10^5
S consists of lowercase English letters.

Description
    Given a string S of lowercase letters, a duplicate removal consists of choosing
    two adjacent and equal letters, and removing them.
    We repeatedly make duplicate removals on S until we no longer can.
    Return the final string after all such duplicate removals have been made.  It is
    guaranteed the answer is unique.
Example 1:
    Input: "abbaca"
    Output: "ca"
    Explanation:
    For example, in "abbaca" we could remove "bb" since the letters are adjacent and
    equal, and this is the only possible move.  The result of this move is that the
    string is "aaca", of which only "aa" is possible, so the final string is "ca".
 1047. Remove All Adjacent Duplicates In String

 1078. Occurrences After Bigram
 Description
   Given words first and second, consider occurrences in some text of the form
"first second third", where second comes immediately after first, and third
comes immediately after second.
For each such occurrence, add "third" to the answer, and return the answer.
Example 1:

= "good"
Output: ["girl","student"]
Example 2:
Input: text = "we will we will rock you", first = "we", second = "will"
Output: ["we","rock"]

   Note:
1 <= text.length <= 1000
text consists of space separated words, where each word consists of lowercase
English letters.
1 <= first.length, second.length <= 10
first and second consist of lowercase English letters.

 1119. Remove Vowels from a String
 Description
   Given a string S, remove the vowels 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u' from it, and
return the new string.
Example 1:

 1160. Find Words That Can Be Formed by Characters
Description
    You are given an array of strings words and a string chars.
    A string is good if it can be formed by characters from chars (each character
    can only be used once).
    Return the sum of lengths of all good strings in words.
Example 1:
    Input: words = ["cat","bt","hat","tree"], chars = "atach"
    Output: 6
    Explanation:
    The strings that can be formed are "cat" and "hat" so the answer is 3 + 3 = 6.
    Example 2:
    
       Input: words = ["hello","world","leetcode"], chars = "welldonehoneyr"
    Output: 10
    Explanation:
    The strings that can be formed are "hello" and "world" so the answer is 5 + 5 =
    10.
Note:
    1 <= words.length <= 1000
    1 <= words[i].length, chars.length <= 100
    All strings contain lowercase English letters only.

 1165. Single-Row Keyboard
 Description
   There is a special keyboard with all keys in a single row.
Given a string keyboard of length 26 indicating the layout of the keyboard
(indexed from 0 to 25), initially your finger is at index 0. To type a
character, you have to move your finger to the index of the desired character.
The time taken to move your finger from index i to index j is |i - j|.
You want to type a string word. Write a function to calculate how much time it
takes to type it with one finger.
Example 1:
Input: keyboard = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz", word = "cba"
Output: 4
Explanation: The index moves from 0 to 2 to write 'c' then to 1 to write 'b'
then to 0 again to write 'a'.
Total time = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4.
Example 2:
Input: keyboard = "pqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmno", word = "leetcode"
Output: 73
Constraints:
keyboard.length == 26
keyboard contains each English lowercase letter exactly once in some order.
1 <= word.length <= 10^4
word[i] is an English lowercase letter.
 Solution
01/29/2020:
    class Solution {
    public:

        for (auto i = 0; i < (int)keyboard.size(); ++i) {
   m[keyboard[i]] = i;

           }

last = m[c]; }
return ret; }

1180. Count Substrings with Only One Distinct Letter
Description
     Given a string S, return the number of substrings that have only one distinct
letter.
Example 1:
Input: S = "aaaba"
Output: 8
Explanation: The substrings with one distinct letter are "aaa", "aa", "a", "b".
"aaa" occurs 1 time.
"aa" occurs 2 times.
"a" occurs 4 times.
"b" occurs 1 time.
So the answer is 1 + 2 + 4 + 1 = 8.
Example 2:
Input: S = "aaaaaaaaaa"
Output: 55
Constraints:
1 <= S.length <= 1000
S[i] consists of only lowercase English letters.

      start = i + 1;
} }
  ret += (S.size() - start) * (S.size() - start + 1) / 2;
return ret; }
     Balanced strings are those who have equal quantity of 'L' and 'R' characters.
Given a balanced string s split it in the maximum amount of balanced strings.
Return the maximum amount of splitted balanced strings.
Example 1:
Input: s = "RLRRLLRLRL"
Output: 4
Explanation: s can be split into "RL", "RRLL", "RL", "RL", each substring
contains same number of 'L' and 'R'.
Example 2:
Input: s = "RLLLLRRRLR"
Output: 3
Explanation: s can be split into "RL", "LLLRRR", "LR", each substring contains
same number of 'L' and 'R'.
Example 3:
Input: s = "LLLLRRRR"
Output: 1
Explanation: s can be split into "LLLLRRRR".
Example 4:
Input: s = "RLRRRLLRLL"

   Output: 2
Explanation: s can be split into "RL", "RRRLLRLL", since each substring contains
an equal number of 'L' and 'R'
    Constraints:
    1 <= s.length <= 1000
    s[i] = 'L' or 'R'
Solution
01/29/2020:

 1236. Web Crawler
 Description
   Given a url startUrl and an interface HtmlParser, implement a web crawler to
crawl all links that are under the same hostname as startUrl.
Return all urls obtained by your web crawler in any order.
Your crawler should:
Start from the page: startUrl
Call HtmlParser.getUrls(url) to get all urls from a webpage of given url.
Do not crawl the same link twice.
Explore only the links that are under the same hostname as startUrl.

   As shown in the example url above, the hostname is example.org. For simplicity
sake, you may assume all urls use http protocol without any port specified. For
example, the urls http://leetcode.com/problems and http://leetcode.com/contest
are under the same hostname, while urls http://example.org/test and
http://example.com/abc are not under the same hostname.
The HtmlParser interface is defined as such:
interface HtmlParser {
  // Return a list of all urls from a webpage of given url.
  public List<String> getUrls(String url);
}
Below are two examples explaining the functionality of the problem, for custom
testing purposes you'll have three variables urls, edges and startUrl. Notice
that you will only have access to startUrl in your code, while urls and edges
are not directly accessible to you in code.
Example 1:
Input:
urls = [
  "http://news.yahoo.com",
  "http://news.yahoo.com/news",
  "http://news.yahoo.com/news/topics/",
  "http://news.google.com",
  "http://news.yahoo.com/us"
]
edges = [[2,0],[2,1],[3,2],[3,1],[0,4]]
startUrl = "http://news.yahoo.com/news/topics/"
Output: [
  "http://news.yahoo.com",
  "http://news.yahoo.com/news",
  "http://news.yahoo.com/news/topics/",
  "http://news.yahoo.com/us"
]
Example 2:
Input:
urls = [
  "http://news.yahoo.com",
  "http://news.yahoo.com/news",
  "http://news.yahoo.com/news/topics/",
  "http://news.google.com"

       ]
    edges = [[0,2],[2,1],[3,2],[3,1],[3,0]]
    startUrl = "http://news.google.com"
    Output: ["http://news.google.com"]
    Explanation: The startUrl links to all other pages that do not share the same
    hostname.
    Constraints:
    1 <= urls.length <= 1000
    1 <= urls[i].length <= 300
    startUrl is one of the urls.
    Hostname label must be from 1 to 63 characters long, including the dots, may
    contain only the ASCII letters from 'a' to 'z', digits  from '0' to '9' and the
    hyphen-minus character ('-').
    The hostname may not start or end with the hyphen-minus character ('-').
    See:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostname#Restrictions_on_valid_hostnames
    You may assume there're no duplicates in url library.

1427. Perform String Shifts
    You are given a string s containing lowercase English letters, and a matrix
shift, where shift[i] = [direction, amount]:
direction can be 0 (for left shift) or 1 (for right shift).
amount is the amount by which string s is to be shifted.
A left shift by 1 means remove the first character of s and append it to the
end.
Similarly, a right shift by 1 means remove the last character of s and add it to
the beginning.
Return the final string after all operations.
Example 1:
Input: s = "abc", shift = [[0,1],[1,2]]
Output: "cab"
Explanation:
[0,1] means shift to left by 1. "abc" -> "bca"
[1,2] means shift to right by 2. "bca" -> "cab"
Example 2:
Input: s = "abcdefg", shift = [[1,1],[1,1],[0,2],[1,3]]
Output: "efgabcd"
Explanation:
[1,1] means shift to right by 1. "abcdefg" -> "gabcdef"
[1,1] means shift to right by 1. "gabcdef" -> "fgabcde"
[0,2] means shift to left by 2. "fgabcde" -> "abcdefg"
[1,3] means shift to right by 3. "abcdefg" -> "efgabcd"

   Constraints:
    1 <= s.length <= 100
    s only contains lower case English letters.
    1 <= shift.length <= 100

 1432. Max Difference You Can Get From Changing an Integer
Description
    You are given an integer num. You will apply the following steps exactly two
    times:
    Pick a digit x (0 <= x <= 9).
    Pick another digit y (0 <= y <= 9). The digit y can be equal to x.
    Replace all the occurrences of x in the decimal representation of num by y.
    The new integer cannot have any leading zeros, also the new integer cannot be 0.
    Let a and b be the results of applying the operations to num the first and
    second times, respectively.
    Return the max difference between a and b.
Example 1:
    
       Input: num = 555
    Output: 888
    Explanation: The first time pick x = 5 and y = 9 and store the new integer in a.
    The second time pick x = 5 and y = 1 and store the new integer in b.
    We have now a = 999 and b = 111 and max difference = 888
    Example 2:
    Input: num = 9
    Output: 8
    Explanation: The first time pick x = 9 and y = 9 and store the new integer in a.
    The second time pick x = 9 and y = 1 and store the new integer in b.
    We have now a = 9 and b = 1 and max difference = 8
    Example 3:
    Input: num = 123456
    Output: 820000
    Example 4:

1455. Check If a Word Occurs As a Prefix of Any Word in a Sentence
Description
    Given a sentence that consists of some words separated by a single space, and a
    searchWord.
    You have to check if searchWord is a prefix of any word in sentence.
    Return the index of the word in sentence where searchWord is a prefix of this
    word (1-indexed).
    If searchWord is a prefix of more than one word, return the index of the first
    word (minimum index). If there is no such word return -1.
     A prefix of a string S is any leading contiguous substring of S.

   Example 1:
    Input: sentence = "i love eating burger", searchWord = "burg"
    Output: 4
    Explanation: "burg" is prefix of "burger" which is the 4th word in the sentence.
    Example 2:
    Input: sentence = "this problem is an easy problem", searchWord = "pro"
    Output: 2
    Explanation: "pro" is prefix of "problem" which is the 2nd and the 6th word in
    the sentence, but we return 2 as it's the minimal index.
Example 3:
    Input: sentence = "i am tired", searchWord = "you"
    Output: -1
    Explanation: "you" is not a prefix of any word in the sentence.
    Example 4:
    Input: sentence = "i use triple pillow", searchWord = "pill"
    Output: 4
    Example 5:
    Input: sentence = "hello from the other side", searchWord = "they"
    Output: -1
    Constraints:
    1 <= sentence.length <= 100
    1 <= searchWord.length <= 10
    sentence consists of lowercase English letters and spaces.
    searchWord consists of lowercase English letters.

1456. Maximum Number of Vowels in a Substring of Given Length
Description
    Given a string s and an integer k.
    Return the maximum number of vowel letters in any substring of s with length k.
    Vowel letters in English are (a, e, i, o, u).
Example 1:
    Input: s = "abciiidef", k = 3
    Output: 3
    Explanation: The substring "iii" contains 3 vowel letters.
    Example 2:
    Input: s = "aeiou", k = 2
    Output: 2
    Explanation: Any substring of length 2 contains 2 vowels.
    Example 3:
    Input: s = "leetcode", k = 3
    Output: 2
    Explanation: "lee", "eet" and "ode" contain 2 vowels.
    Example 4:
    Input: s = "rhythms", k = 4
    Output: 0
    Explanation: We can see that s doesn't have any vowel letters.
    Example 5:
    Input: s = "tryhard", k = 4
    Output: 1
     Constraints:

   1 <= s.length <= 10^5
s consists of lowercase English letters.
1 <= k <= s.length

 1487. Making File Names Unique
 Description
   Given an array of strings names of size n. You will create n folders in your
file system such that, at the ith minute, you will create a folder with the name
names[i].
Since two files cannot have the same name, if you enter a folder name which is
previously used, the system will have a suffix addition to its name in the form
of (k), where, k is the smallest positive integer such that the obtained name
remains unique.
Return an array of strings of length n where ans[i] is the actual name the
system will assign to the ith folder when you create it.
Example 1:
Input: names = ["pes","fifa","gta","pes(2019)"]
Output: ["pes","fifa","gta","pes(2019)"]
Explanation: Let's see how the file system creates folder names:
"pes" --> not assigned before, remains "pes"

       "fifa" --> not assigned before, remains "fifa"
    "gta" --> not assigned before, remains "gta"
    "pes(2019)" --> not assigned before, remains "pes(2019)"
    Example 2:
    Input: names = ["gta","gta(1)","gta","avalon"]
    Output: ["gta","gta(1)","gta(2)","avalon"]
    Explanation: Let's see how the file system creates folder names:
    "gta" --> not assigned before, remains "gta"
    "gta(1)" --> not assigned before, remains "gta(1)"
    "gta" --> the name is reserved, system adds (k), since "gta(1)" is also
    reserved, systems put k = 2. it becomes "gta(2)"
    "avalon" --> not assigned before, remains "avalon"
    Example 3:
    Input: names = ["onepiece","onepiece(1)","onepiece(2)","onepiece(3)","onepiece"]
    Output: ["onepiece","onepiece(1)","onepiece(2)","onepiece(3)","onepiece(4)"]
    Explanation: When the last folder is created, the smallest positive valid k is
    4, and it becomes "onepiece(4)".
Example 4:
    Input: names = ["wano","wano","wano","wano"]
    Output: ["wano","wano(1)","wano(2)","wano(3)"]
    Explanation: Just increase the value of k each time you create folder "wano".
    Example 5:
    Input: names = ["kaido","kaido(1)","kaido","kaido(1)"]
    Output: ["kaido","kaido(1)","kaido(2)","kaido(1)(1)"]
    Explanation: Please note that system adds the suffix (k) to current name even it
    contained the same suffix before.
    Constraints:
    1 <= names.length <= 5 * 10^4
    1 <= names[i].length <= 20
    names[i] consists of lower case English letters, digits and/or round brackets.

 Description
695. Max Area of Island
    
    Given a non-empty 2D array grid of 0's and 1's, an island is a group of 1's
(representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.) You may
assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.
Find the maximum area of an island in the given 2D array. (If there is no
island, the maximum area is 0.)
Example 1:
[[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],
 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
 [0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
 [0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],
 [0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],
 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],
 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]]
Given the above grid, return 6. Note the answer is not 11, because the island
must be connected 4-directionally.
Example 2:
[[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]
Given the above grid, return 0.
Note: The length of each dimension in the given grid does not exceed 50.

 886. Possible Bipartition
    Given a set of N people (numbered 1, 2, ..., N), we would like to split everyone
into two groups of any size.
Each person may dislike some other people, and they should not go into the same
group.
Formally, if dislikes[i] = [a, b], it means it is not allowed to put the people
numbered a and b into the same group.
Return true if and only if it is possible to split everyone into two groups in
this way.
Example 1:
Input: N = 4, dislikes = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,4]]
Output: true
Explanation: group1 [1,4], group2 [2,3]
Example 2:
Input: N = 3, dislikes = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,3]]
Output: false
Example 3:
Input: N = 5, dislikes = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,5],[1,5]]
Output: false
Note:
1 <= N <= 2000
0 <= dislikes.length <= 10000

       1 <= dislikes[i][j] <= N
    dislikes[i][0] < dislikes[i][1]

 1222. Queens That Can Attack the King
    On an 8x8 chessboard, there can be multiple Black Queens and one White King.
Given an array of integer coordinates queens that represents the positions of
the Black Queens, and a pair of coordinates king that represent the position of
the White King, return the coordinates of all the queens (in any order) that can
attack the King.
Example 1:
Input: queens = [[0,1],[1,0],[4,0],[0,4],[3,3],[2,4]], king = [0,0]
Output: [[0,1],[1,0],[3,3]]
Explanation:
The queen at [0,1] can attack the king cause they're in the same row.
The queen at [1,0] can attack the king cause they're in the same column.
The queen at [3,3] can attack the king cause they're in the same diagnal.
The queen at [0,4] can't attack the king cause it's blocked by the queen at
[0,1].
The queen at [4,0] can't attack the king cause it's blocked by the queen at
[1,0].
The queen at [2,4] can't attack the king cause it's not in the same
row/column/diagnal as the king.
Example 2:
Input: queens = [[0,0],[1,1],[2,2],[3,4],[3,5],[4,4],[4,5]], king = [3,3]

 1489. Find Critical and Pseudo-Critical Edges in Minimum Spanning Tree
Description
    Given a weighted undirected connected graph with n vertices numbered from 0 to
    n-1, and an array edges where edges[i] = [fromi, toi, weighti] represents a
    bidirectional and weighted edge between nodes fromi and toi. A minimum spanning
    tree (MST) is a subset of the edges of the graph that connects all vertices
    without cycles and with the minimum possible total edge weight.
    Find all the critical and pseudo-critical edges in the minimum spanning tree
    (MST) of the given graph. An MST edge whose deletion from the graph would cause
    the MST weight to increase is called a critical edge. A pseudo-critical edge, on
    the other hand, is that which can appear in some MSTs but not all.
    Note that you can return the indices of the edges in any order.
Example 1:
    Input: n = 5, edges = [[0,1,1],[1,2,1],[2,3,2],[0,3,2],[0,4,3],[3,4,3],[1,4,6]]
    Output: [[0,1],[2,3,4,5]]
    Explanation: The figure above describes the graph.
    The following figure shows all the possible MSTs:
    Notice that the two edges 0 and 1 appear in all MSTs, therefore they are
    critical edges, so we return them in the first list of the output.
    The edges 2, 3, 4, and 5 are only part of some MSTs, therefore they are
    considered pseudo-critical edges. We add them to the second list of the output.
    Example 2:
    Input: n = 4, edges = [[0,1,1],[1,2,1],[2,3,1],[0,3,1]]
    Output: [[],[0,1,2,3]]
    Explanation: We can observe that since all 4 edges have equal weight, choosing
    any 3 edges from the given 4 will yield an MST. Therefore all 4 edges are
    pseudo-critical.
    Constraints:
    2 <= n <= 100
    
       1 <= edges.length <= min(200, n * (n - 1) / 2)
    edges[i].length == 3
    0 <= fromi < toi < n
    1 <= weighti <= 1000
    All pairs (fromi, toi) are distinct.

876. Middle of the Linked List
     Given a non-empty, singly linked list with head node head, return a middle node
of linked list.
If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.
Example 1:
Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: Node 3 from this list (Serialization: [3,4,5])
The returned node has value 3.  (The judge's serialization of this node is
[3,4,5]).
Note that we returned a ListNode object ans, such that:
ans.val = 3, ans.next.val = 4, ans.next.next.val = 5, and ans.next.next.next =
NULL.
Example 2:

       Input: [1,2,3,4,5,6]
    Output: Node 4 from this list (Serialization: [4,5,6])
    Since the list has two middle nodes with values 3 and 4, we return the second

 461. Hamming Distance
 Description
   The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which
the corresponding bits are different.
Given two integers x and y, calculate the Hamming distance.
Note:
0 ≤ x, y < 231.
Example:
Input: x = 1, y = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: 1 (0001) 4 (0100)
↑↑
The above arrows point to positions where the corresponding bits are different.

ret += m % 2; }
return ret; }
};
 476. Number Complement
 Description
   Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement strategy
is to flip the bits of its binary representation.
Example 1:
Input: 5
Output: 2
Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and
its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.
Example 2:
Input: 1
Output: 0
Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its
complement is 0. So you need to output 0.
Note:
The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed
integer.
You could assume no leading zero bit in the integer’s binary representation.

 Design Data Structure 359. Logger Rate Limiter
 Description
   Design a logger system that receive stream of messages along with its
timestamps, each message should be printed if and only if it is not printed in
the last 10 seconds.
Given a message and a timestamp (in seconds granularity), return true if the
message should be printed in the given timestamp, otherwise returns false.
It is possible that several messages arrive roughly at the same time.
Example:
Logger logger = new Logger();

       // logging string "foo" at timestamp 1
    logger.shouldPrintMessage(1, "foo"); returns true;
    // logging string "bar" at timestamp 2
    logger.shouldPrintMessage(2,"bar"); returns true;
    // logging string "foo" at timestamp 3
    logger.shouldPrintMessage(3,"foo"); returns false;
    // logging string "bar" at timestamp 8
    logger.shouldPrintMessage(8,"bar"); returns false;
    // logging string "foo" at timestamp 10
    logger.shouldPrintMessage(10,"foo"); returns false;
    // logging string "foo" at timestamp 11
    logger.shouldPrintMessage(11,"foo"); returns true;
Solution

901. Online Stock Span
Description
    Write a class StockSpanner which collects daily price quotes for some stock, and
    returns the span of that stock's price for the current day.
    The span of the stock's price today is defined as the maximum number of
    consecutive days (starting from today and going backwards) for which the price
    of the stock was less than or equal to today's price.
    For example, if the price of a stock over the next 7 days were [100, 80, 60, 70,
    60, 75, 85], then the stock spans would be [1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 6].
Example 1:
    Input: ["StockSpanner","next","next","next","next","next","next","next"], [[],
    [100],[80],[60],[70],[60],[75],[85]]
    Output: [null,1,1,1,2,1,4,6]
    Explanation:
    First, S = StockSpanner() is initialized.  Then:
    S.next(100) is called and returns 1,
    S.next(80) is called and returns 1,
    S.next(60) is called and returns 1,
    S.next(70) is called and returns 2,
    S.next(60) is called and returns 1,
    S.next(75) is called and returns 4,
    S.next(85) is called and returns 6.
    Note that (for example) S.next(75) returned 4, because the last 4 prices
    (including today's price of 75) were less than or equal to today's price.
Note:
    Calls to StockSpanner.next(int price) will have 1 <= price <= 10^5.
    There will be at most 10000 calls to StockSpanner.next per test case.
    There will be at most 150000 calls to StockSpanner.next across all test cases.
     
       The total time limit for this problem has been reduced by 75% for C++, and 50%
    for all other languages.

    queue, and returns -1 if there is no such integer.
    void add(int value) insert value to the queue.
Example 1:
    Input:
    ["FirstUnique","showFirstUnique","add","showFirstUnique","add","showFirstUnique"
    ,"add","showFirstUnique"]
    [[[2,3,5]],[],[5],[],[2],[],[3],[]]
    Output:
    [null,2,null,2,null,3,null,-1]
    Explanation:
    FirstUnique firstUnique = new FirstUnique([2,3,5]);
    firstUnique.showFirstUnique(); // return 2
    firstUnique.add(5);            // the queue is now [2,3,5,5]
    firstUnique.showFirstUnique(); // return 2
    firstUnique.add(2);            // the queue is now [2,3,5,5,2]
    firstUnique.showFirstUnique(); // return 3
    firstUnique.add(3);            // the queue is now [2,3,5,5,2,3]
    firstUnique.showFirstUnique(); // return -1
Example 2:
    Input:
    ["FirstUnique","showFirstUnique","add","add","add","add","add","showFirstUnique"
    ]
    [[[7,7,7,7,7,7]],[],[7],[3],[3],[7],[17],[]]
    Output:
    [null,-1,null,null,null,null,null,17]
    Explanation:
    FirstUnique firstUnique = new FirstUnique([7,7,7,7,7,7]);
    firstUnique.showFirstUnique(); // return -1
    firstUnique.add(7);            // the queue is now [7,7,7,7,7,7,7]
    firstUnique.add(3);            // the queue is now [7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3]
   
   firstUnique.add(3);
firstUnique.add(7);
firstUnique.add(17);
firstUnique.showFirstUnique(); // return 17
// the queue is now [7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3]
// the queue is now [7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3,7]
// the queue is now [7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3,7,17]
Example 3:
    Input:
    ["FirstUnique","showFirstUnique","add","showFirstUnique"]
    [[[809]],[],[809],[]]
    Output:
    [null,809,null,-1]
    Explanation:
    FirstUnique firstUnique = new FirstUnique([809]);
    firstUnique.showFirstUnique(); // return 809
    firstUnique.add(809);          // the queue is now [809,809]
    firstUnique.showFirstUnique(); // return -1
    Constraints:
    1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
    1 <= nums[i] <= 10^8
    1 <= value <= 10^8
    At most 50000 calls will be made to showFirstUnique and add.
    * Hide Hint #1: Use doubly Linked list with hashmap of pointers to linked list
    nodes. add unique number to the linked list. When add is called check if the
    added number is unique then it have to be added to the linked list and if it is
    repeated remove it from the linked list if exists. When showFirstUnique is
    called retrieve the head of the linked list.
    * Hide Hint #2: Use queue and check that first element of the queue is always
    unique.
    * Hide Hint #3: Use set or heap to make running time of each function O(logn).
Solution
Using vector:
    class FirstUnique {
      unordered_map<int, int> mp;
      vector<int> unique_nums;
      int i;
    public:
      FirstUnique(vector<int>& nums) {
        i = 0;
        for (auto& n : nums) ++mp[n];
        for (auto& n : nums)
     
             if (mp[n] == 1)
            unique_nums.push_back(n);
}
      int showFirstUnique() {
        if (i >= unique_nums.size()) return -1;
        return unique_nums[i];
}
      void add(int value) {
        if (++mp[value] == 1) unique_nums.push_back(value);
        for (; i < unique_nums.size() && mp[unique_nums[i]] > 1; ++i);
} };

     */
Using queue:
    class FirstUnique {
      unordered_map<int, int> mp;
      queue<int> unique_nums;
    public:
      FirstUnique(vector<int>& nums) {

1472. Design Browser History
Description
    You have a browser of one tab where you start on the homepage and you can visit
    another url, get back in the history number of steps or move forward in the
    history number of steps.
    Implement the BrowserHistory class:
    BrowserHistory(string homepage) Initializes the object with the homepage of the
    browser.
    void visit(string url) visits url from the current page. It clears up all the
    forward history.
    string back(int steps) Move steps back in history. If you can only return x
    steps in the history and steps > x, you will return only x steps. Return the
    current url after moving back in history at most steps.
    string forward(int steps) Move steps forward in history. If you can only forward
    x steps in the history and steps > x, you will forward only x steps. Return the
    current url after forwarding in history at most steps.
Example:
    Input:
    ["BrowserHistory","visit","visit","visit","back","back","forward","visit","forwa
    rd","back","back"]
    [["leetcode.com"],["google.com"],["facebook.com"],["youtube.com"],[1],[1],[1],
    ["linkedin.com"],[2],[2],[7]]
    Output:
    [null,null,null,null,"facebook.com","google.com","facebook.com",null,"linkedin.c
    om","google.com","leetcode.com"]
    Explanation:
    BrowserHistory browserHistory = new BrowserHistory("leetcode.com");
    browserHistory.visit("google.com");       // You are in "leetcode.com". Visit
    "google.com"
    browserHistory.visit("facebook.com");     // You are in "google.com". Visit
    "facebook.com"
     
   browserHistory.visit("youtube.com");
"youtube.com"
browserHistory.back(1);
to "facebook.com" return "facebook.com"
browserHistory.back(1);
// You are in "facebook.com". Visit
// You are in "youtube.com", move back
// You are in "facebook.com", move
back to "google.com" return "google.com"
browserHistory.forward(1);
forward to "facebook.com" return "facebook.com"
browserHistory.visit("linkedin.com");
"linkedin.com"
browserHistory.forward(2);
cannot move forward any steps.
browserHistory.back(2);
// You are in "google.com", move
// You are in "facebook.com". Visit
// You are in "linkedin.com", you
                                          // You are in "linkedin.com", move
back two steps to "facebook.com" then to "google.com". return "google.com"
    browserHistory.back(7);                   // You are in "google.com", you can
    move back only one step to "leetcode.com". return "leetcode.com"
    Constraints:
    1 <= homepage.length <= 20
    1 <= url.length <= 20
    1 <= steps <= 100
    homepage and url consist of  '.' or lower case English letters.
    At most 5000 calls will be made to visit, back, and forward.

    class BrowserHistory {
    private:
      list<string> history;
      int x;
    public:
      BrowserHistory(string homepage) {

1476. Subrectangle Queries
Description
    Implement the class SubrectangleQueries which receives a rows x cols rectangle
    as a matrix of integers in the constructor and supports two methods:
    1. updateSubrectangle(int row1, int col1, int row2, int col2, int newValue)
    Updates all values with newValue in the subrectangle whose upper left coordinate
    is (row1,col1) and bottom right coordinate is (row2,col2).
    2. getValue(int row, int col)
    Returns the current value of the coordinate (row,col) from the rectangle.
Example 1:
    Input
    ["SubrectangleQueries","getValue","updateSubrectangle","getValue","getValue","up
    dateSubrectangle","getValue","getValue"]
    [[[[1,2,1],[4,3,4],[3,2,1],[1,1,1]]],[0,2],[0,0,3,2,5],[0,2],[3,1],[3,0,3,2,10],
    [3,1],[0,2]]
    Output
    [null,1,null,5,5,null,10,5]
    Explanation
     
   SubrectangleQueries subrectangleQueries = new SubrectangleQueries([[1,2,1],
[4,3,4],[3,2,1],[1,1,1]]);
// The initial rectangle (4x3) looks like:
// 1 2 1
// 4 3 4
// 3 2 1
// 1 1 1
subrectangleQueries.getValue(0, 2); // return 1
subrectangleQueries.updateSubrectangle(0, 0, 3, 2, 5);
// After this update the rectangle looks like:
// 5 5 5
// 5 5 5
// 5 5 5
// 5 5 5
subrectangleQueries.getValue(0, 2); // return 5
subrectangleQueries.getValue(3, 1); // return 5
subrectangleQueries.updateSubrectangle(3, 0, 3, 2, 10);
// After this update the rectangle looks like:
//5 5 5
//5 5 5
//5 5 5
// 10 10 10
subrectangleQueries.getValue(3, 1); // return 10 subrectangleQueries.getValue(0, 2); // return 5 Example 2:
Input
["SubrectangleQueries","getValue","updateSubrectangle","getValue","getValue","up
dateSubrectangle","getValue"]
[[[[1,1,1],[2,2,2],[3,3,3]]],[0,0],[0,0,2,2,100],[0,0],[2,2],[1,1,2,2,20],[2,2]]
Output
[null,1,null,100,100,null,20]
Explanation
SubrectangleQueries subrectangleQueries = new SubrectangleQueries([[1,1,1],
[2,2,2],[3,3,3]]);
subrectangleQueries.getValue(0, 0); // return 1
subrectangleQueries.updateSubrectangle(0, 0, 2, 2, 100);
subrectangleQueries.getValue(0, 0); // return 100
subrectangleQueries.getValue(2, 2); // return 100
subrectangleQueries.updateSubrectangle(1, 1, 2, 2, 20);
subrectangleQueries.getValue(2, 2); // return 20
Constraints:
There will be at most 500 operations considering both methods:
updateSubrectangle and getValue.
1 <= rows, cols <= 100
rows == rectangle.length

       cols == rectangle[i].length
    0 <= row1 <= row2 < rows
    0 <= col1 <= col2 < cols
    1 <= newValue, rectangle[i][j] <= 10^9
    0 <= row < rows
0 <= col < cols
Solution
06/13/2020:
    class SubrectangleQueries {
private:
  vector<vector<int>> rectangle;
public:
  SubrectangleQueries(vector<vector<int>>& rectangle) {
    this->rectangle = rectangle;
}
  void updateSubrectangle(int row1, int col1, int row2, int col2, int newValue)
{
    for (int i = row1; i <= row2; ++i) {
      for (int j = col1; j <= col2; ++j) {
        rectangle[i][j] = newValue;
      }
} }
  int getValue(int row, int col) {
    return rectangle[row][col];
} };
/**
 * Your SubrectangleQueries object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * SubrectangleQueries* obj = new SubrectangleQueries(rectangle);
